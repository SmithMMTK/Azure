Type | Common sizes	| Description
--- | --- | ---
General purpose	 | Dsv3, Dv3, DSv2, Dv2, DS, D, Av2, A0-7 | Balanced CPU-to-memory. Ideal for dev / test and small to medium applications and data solutions.
Compute optimized | Fs, F | High CPU-to-memory. Good for medium traffic applications, network appliances, and batch processes.
Memory optimized | Esv3, Ev3, M, GS, G, DSv2, DS, Dv2, D | High memory-to-core. Great for relational databases, medium to large caches, and in-memory analytics.
Storage optimized | Ls | High disk throughput and IO. Ideal for Big Data, SQL, and NoSQL databases.
GPU | NV, NC | Specialized VMs targeted for heavy graphic rendering and video editing.
High performance | H, A8-11 | Our most powerful CPU VMs with optional high-throughput network interfaces (RDMA).
