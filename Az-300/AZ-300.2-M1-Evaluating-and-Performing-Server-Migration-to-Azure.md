### Assessment and Discovery - Azure Migrate

__Overview of the Azure Migrate Service__
![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/7c421c05d57fa3a3617eec6eb4f98963/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.2+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ101.1_Migrate_Servers_to_Azure_image5.png)

You can discover up to 1500 VMs in a single discovery and up to 1500 VMs in a single project. Additionally, you can assess up to 1500 VMs in a single assessment. If you want to discover a larger environment you can split the discovery and create multiple projects, learn more. Azure Migrate supports up to 20 projects per subscription

__Azure Migrate - Process Overview__
We’ve talked about the concepts and use cases for Azure Migrate. Now let's look at the process of using Azure Migrate to discover and assess on-premises workloads for migration to Azure. We'll begin by looking at a basic architectural illustration of that process.

Architecture

The basic architecture of the Azure Migration service is shown in the following diagram. Azure Migrate service works to discover information about ESXi hosts and VMs in a VMware vCenter server. An assessment is created as an outcome of the discovery process.

__Discovery of On-premises Environment__

__Configuring the Collector__

Once you have downloaded the collector appliance and imported it into a virtual machine that's now running your collector, you then log into the virtual machine for the first time. You are presented with a very simple four step process that helps you configure your Azure Migrate project to get started with assessments.

__Assessing Readiness__

Using a VMware environment, for example, Azure Migrate collects performance history of on-premises VMs from the vCenter Server. To ensure accurate right-sizing, you should ensure that the statistics setting in vCenter Server is set to level 3 and wait for at least a day before initiating discovery of the on-premises VMs. If the statistics setting in vCenter Server is below level 3, performance data for disk and network is not collected.

__Best Practice - Secure Migrated Workloads to Azure__

__Encrypt Data__

__Encryption for IaaS__
- __VMs:__ For VMs you can use Azure Disk Encryption to encrypt your Windows and Linux IaaS VM disks.

    - Disk encryption leverages BitLocker for Windows, and DM-Crypt for Linux to provide volume encryption for the OS and data disks.
    
    - You can use an encryption key created by Azure, or you can supply your own encryption keys, safeguarded in Azure Key Vault.
    
    - With Disk Encryption, IaaS VM data is secured at rest (on the disk) and during VM boot.
    
    - Azure Security Center alerts you if you have VMs that aren't encrypted.

- __Storage:__ Protect at rest data stored in Azure storage.
    - Data stored in Azure storage accounts can be encrypted using Microsoft-generated AES keys that are FIPS 140-2 compliant, or you can use your own keys.

    - Storage Service Encryption is enabled for all new and existing storage accounts and can't be disabled.

__Encryption for PaaS__
Unlike IaaS where you manage your own VMs and infrastructure, in a PaaS model platform and infrastructure is managed by the provider, leaving you to focus on core app logic and capabilities. With so many different types of PaaS services, each service will be evaluated individually for security purposes. As an example, let's see how we might enable encryption for Azure SQL Database.

- __Always Encrypted:__ Use the Always Encrypted Wizard in SQL Server Management Studio to protect data at rest.

    - You create Always Encrypted key to encrypt individual column data.
    
    - Always Encrypted keys can be stored as encrypted in database metadata, or stored in trusted key stores such as Azure Key Vault.
    
    - App changes will probably be needed to use this feature.
> End-user side process

- __Transparent data encryption (TDE)__ Protect the Azure SQL Database with real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated backups, and transaction log files at rest.

    - TDE allows encryption activities to take place without changes at the app layer.

    - TDE can use encryption keys provided by Microsoft, or you can provide your own keys using Bring Your Own Key support.

__Secure Web Apps__

__Azure Key Vault__

Today web app developers are taking steps to ensure that sensitive information isn't leaked from these files. One method to secure information is to extract it from files and put it into an Azure Key Vault.

- You can use Key Vault to centralize storage of app secrets, and control their distribution. It avoids the need to store security information in app files.

- Apps can security access information in the vault using URIs, without needing custom code.

- Azure Key Vault allows you to lock down access via Azure security controls and to seamlessly implement ‘rolling keys’. Microsoft does not see or extract your data.

__Review Subscriptions and Resource Permissions__

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/e180eca2bd98b480fd51831e85c20d5d/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.2+2019_T2+type@asset+block/WS500_Best_Practices_image5a.png)

As you migrate your workloads and run them in Azure, staff with workload access move around. Your security team should review access to your Azure tenant and resource groups on a regular basis. Azure provides a number of offerings for identity management and access control security, including role-based access control (RBAC) to authorize permissions to access Azure resources.

RBAC assigns access permissions for security principals. Security principals represent users, groups (a set of users), service principals (identity used by apps and services), and managed identities (an Azure Active Directory identity automatically managed by Azure).

RBAC can assign roles to security principles, such as owner, contributor and reader, and role definitions (a collection of permissions) that define the operations that can be performed by the roles.

RBAC can also set scopes that set the boundary for a role. Scope can be set at a number of levels, including a management group, subscription, resource group, or resource

Ensure that admins with Azure access are only able to access resources that you want to allow. If the predefined roles in Azure aren't granular enough, you can create custom roles to separate and limit access permissions.

__Best practice: Review audit and security logs__
