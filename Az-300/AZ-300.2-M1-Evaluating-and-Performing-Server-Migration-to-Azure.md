### Assessment and Discovery - Azure Migrate

__Overview of the Azure Migrate Service__

You can discover up to 1500 VMs in a single discovery and up to 1500 VMs in a single project. Additionally, you can assess up to 1500 VMs in a single assessment. If you want to discover a larger environment you can split the discovery and create multiple projects, learn more. Azure Migrate supports up to 20 projects per subscription

__Azure Migrate - Process Overview__
Weâ€™ve talked about the concepts and use cases for Azure Migrate. Now let's look at the process of using Azure Migrate to discover and assess on-premises workloads for migration to Azure. We'll begin by looking at a basic architectural illustration of that process.

Architecture

The basic architecture of the Azure Migration service is shown in the following diagram. Azure Migrate service works to discover information about ESXi hosts and VMs in a VMware vCenter server. An assessment is created as an outcome of the discovery process.

__Discovery of On-premises Environment__

__Configuring the Collector__

Once you have downloaded the collector appliance and imported it into a virtual machine that's now running your collector, you then log into the virtual machine for the first time. You are presented with a very simple four step process that helps you configure your Azure Migrate project to get started with assessments.

__Assessing Readiness__

Using a VMware environment, for example, Azure Migrate collects performance history of on-premises VMs from the vCenter Server. To ensure accurate right-sizing, you should ensure that the statistics setting in vCenter Server is set to level 3 and wait for at least a day before initiating discovery of the on-premises VMs. If the statistics setting in vCenter Server is below level 3, performance data for disk and network is not collected.

<tr>
<td><strong>Rehost</strong></td>
<td>Often referred to as a <em>lift-and-shift</em> migration. This option doesn't require code changes, and let's you migrate your existing apps to Azure quickly. Each app is migrated as is, to reap the benefits of the cloud, without the risk and cost associated with code changes.</td>
<td>When you need to move apps quickly to the cloud.<br><br>When you want to move an app without modifying it.<br><br>When your apps are architected so that they can leverage <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-iaas/" title="" target="_blank" data-generated="">Azure IaaS</a> scalability after migration.<br><br>When apps are important to your business, but you don't need immediate changes to app capabilities.<br></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Refactor</strong></td>
<td>Often referred to as <em>repackaging</em>, refactoring requires minimal changes to apps, so that they can connect to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-paas/" title="" target="_blank" data-generated="">Azure PaaS</a>, and use cloud offerings.<br><br>For example, you could migrate existing apps to Azure App Service or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).<br><br>Or, you could refactor relational and non-relational databases into options such as Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and Azure Cosmos DB.<br></td>
<td>If your app can easily be repackaged to work in Azure<br><br>If you want to apply innovative DevOps practices provided by Azure, or you're thinking about DevOps using a container strategy for workloads.<br><br>For refactoring, you need to think about the portability of your existing code base, and available development skills<br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Rearchitect</strong></td>
<td>Rearchitecting for migration focuses on modifying and extending app functionality and the code base to optimize the app architecture for cloud scalability.<br><br>For example, you could break down a monolithic application into a group of microservices that work together and scale easily.<br><br>Or, you could rearchitect relational and non-relational databases to a fully managed DBaaS solutions, such as Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and Azure Cosmos DB.<br></td>
<td>When your apps need major revisions to incorporate new capabilities, or to work effectively on a cloud platform.<br><br>When you want to use existing application investments, meet scalability requirements, apply innovative Azure DevOps practices, and minimize use of virtual machines.<br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Rebuild</strong></td>
<td>Rebuild takes things a step further by rebuilding an app from scratch using Azure cloud technologies.<br><br>For example, you could build green field apps with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/cloudnative/" title="" target="_blank" data-generated="">cloud-native</a> technologies like Azure Functions, Azure AI, Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, and Azure Cosmos DB.<br><br></td>
<td>When you want rapid development, and existing apps have limited functionality and lifespan.<br><br>When you're ready to expedite business innovation (including DevOps practices provided by Azure), build new applications using cloud-native technologies, and take advantage of advancements in AI, Blockchain, and IoT.<br></td>
