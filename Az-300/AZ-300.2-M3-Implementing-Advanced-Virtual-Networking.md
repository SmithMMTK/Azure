The Azure Load Balancer delivers high availability and network performance to your applications. It is an OSI Layer 4 (TCP and UDP) load balancer that distributes inbound traffic to backend resources using load balancing rules and health probes. Load balancing rules determine how traffic is distributed to the backend. Health probes ensure the resources in the backend are healthy.

There are two types of load balancers: __public__ and __internal__.

A public load balancer maps the public IP address and port number of incoming traffic to the private IP address and port number of the VM, and vice versa for the response traffic from the VM. By applying load-balancing rules, you can distribute specific types of traffic across multiple VMs or services. For example, you can spread the load of incoming web request traffic across multiple web servers.

An internal load balancer directs traffic only to resources that are inside a virtual network or that use a VPN to access Azure infrastructure. Frontend IP addresses and virtual networks are never directly exposed to an internet endpoint. Internal line-of-business applications run in Azure and are accessed from within Azure or from on-premises resources. For example, an internal load balancer could receive database requests that need to be distributed to backend SQL servers

__Load Balancer SKUs__

When you create an Azure Load Balancer you will select for the type (Internal or Public) of load balancer. You will also select the SKU. The load balancer supports both Basic and Standard SKUs, each differing in scenario scale, features, and pricing. The Standard Load Balancer is the newer Load Balancer product with an expanded and more granular feature set over Basic Load Balancer. It is a superset of Basic Load Balancer.
> SKUs are not mutable. You may not change the SKU of an existing resource

__Backend Pool__

-	| Standard SKU	| Basic SKU
--- | --- | --- 
Backend pool endpoints	| Any VM in a single virtual network, including a blend of VMs, availability sets, and VM scale sets.	| VMs in a single availability set or VM scale set.

__Load Balancer Rules__

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/ab52616ee8cdb979ca174b46d3c45764/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.2+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-101.3_Implementing_Advanced_Virtual_Networking_image7.png)

Load balancing rules can be used in combination with NAT rules. For example, you could NAT TCP from the load balancer’s public address to TCP 3389 on a specific virtual machine. This allows remote desktop access from outside of Azure. Notice in this case, the NAT rule is explicitly attached to a VM (or network interface) to complete the path to the target; whereas a Load Balancing rule need not be.

__Multiple Frontends__
Azure Load Balancer allows you to load balance services on multiple ports, multiple IP addresses, or both. You can use public and internal load balancer definitions to load balance flows across a set of VMs. Adding multiple frontends is incremental to a single frontend configuration.

When you define an Azure Load Balancer, frontend and backend pool configurations are connected with rules. There are two types of rules:

1. The default rule with no backend port reuse
2. The Floating IP rule where backend ports are reused

__Session Persistence__
By default, Azure Load Balancer distributes network traffic equally among multiple VM instances. The load balancer uses a 5-tuple (source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, and protocol type) hash to map traffic to available servers. It provides stickiness only within a transport session.

__Health Probes__
A health probe allows the load balancer to monitor the status of your app. The health probe dynamically adds or removes VMs from the load balancer rotation based on their response to health checks. When a probe fails to respond, the load balancer stops sending new connections to the unhealthy instances.
There are two main ways to configure health probes: __HTTP__ and __TCP__.

HTTP custom probe****. The load balancer regularly probes your endpoint (every 15 seconds, by default). The instance is healthy if it responds with an HTTP 200 within the timeout period (default of 31 seconds). Any status other than HTTP 200 causes this probe to fail. You can specify the port (Port), the URI for requesting the health status from the backend (URI), amount of time between probe attempts (Interval), and the number of failures that must occur for the instance to be considered unhealthy (Unhealthy threshold).

TCP custom probe. This probe relies on establishing a successful TCP session to a defined probe port. If the specified listener on the VM exists, the probe succeeds. If the connection is refused, the probe fails. You can specify the Port, Interval, and Unhealthy threshold.

### Azure Application Gateway

Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications.

Traditional load balancers operate at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP) and route traffic based on source IP address and port, to a destination IP address and port. An example is the Azure Load Balancer. But the __Application Gateway is an OSI layer 7 load balancer__, so you can be even more specific in routing your network traffic.

The Application Gateway has many of the same components and configuration tasks as the Load Balancer. But, the terminology is a little different, so let’s review

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/92eccc8317223d17be9fcbafdd52acbe/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.2+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-101.3_Implementing_Advanced_Virtual_Networking_image31.png)

__Web application firewall (WAF)__. A WAF is provided as part of the Application gateway. WAF integration makes security management much simpler and can react faster to a security threat by patching a known vulnerability at a central location versus securing each of the individual web applications.

__Web Application Firewall__

The Azure Application Gateway WAF provides protection for web applications. The WAF uses OWASP rules to protect your application. These rules include protection against attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting attacks, and session hijacks.

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/6d9310334531c75c3a9c6ff8521b2f7a/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.2+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-101.3_Implementing_Advanced_Virtual_Networking_image32.png)

__Health Probes__

By default, Azure Application Gateway monitors the health of all resources in its backend pool and automatically removes any resource considered unhealthy from the pool. Application Gateway continues to monitor the unhealthy instances and adds them back to the healthy backend pool once they become available and respond to health probes.

For example, if you have two backend servers receiving HTTP network traffic on port 80, the default health probe checks every 30 seconds for a healthy HTTP response code between 200-399.

__Application Gateway Sizing__

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/d4e7666f7535d480dad203f8e325b4e6/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.2+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-101.3_Implementing_Advanced_Virtual_Networking_image36.png)

Each SKU provides different performance benefits. The following table shows the average performance throughput based on the backend page size. These are estimates, with SSL offload enabled.

Average back-end page response size	| Small	| Medium	| Large
--- | --- | --- | ---
6KB	| 7.5 Mbps	| 13 Mbps	| 50 Mbps
100KB	| 35 Mbps	| 100 Mbps	| 200 Mbps

We recommend a minimum instance count of __two for production workloads__. Azure distributes instances across update and fault domains to ensure that all instances do not fail at the same time. Your virtual network and public IP address must be in the same location as your gateway.

__Path-Based Routing__

__Multiple Site Hosting__

Multiple site hosting enables you to configure more than one web site on the same Application Gateway instance. __You can add up to 20 web sites to one Application Gateway__. Each web site can be directed to its own backend pool of servers. For example, an Application Gateway can serve traffic for contoso.com and fabrikam.com from two server pools called ContosoServerPool and FabrikamServerPool.

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/357fc61aa034752c17f7d68281ce2fc3/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.2+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-101.3_Implementing_Advanced_Virtual_Networking_image39.png)

__Implementation__

As the above diagram shows you will need to configure two backend server pools and two listeners. You will also need two routing rules to connect the listeners to the backend pools.

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/9207145edab1b53ef097ee7bcbfb1e57/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.2+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-101.3_Implementing_Advanced_Virtual_Networking_image40.png)

__Redirection and Session Affinity__

Application gateway has many useful features. So far, we have addressed the WAF, Path-Based Routing, Multiple Site Hosting, and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Offload. 

Application Gateway supports redirection from one port to another port. This enables HTTP to HTTPS redirection which is a common scenario for all communication between an application and its users occurring over an encrypted path. Application Gateway also supports path-based redirection. This type of redirection enables HTTP to HTTPS redirection only on a specific site area, for example a shopping cart area denoted by /cart/*.

Application Gateway redirection support is not limited to HTTP to HTTPS redirection. This is a generic redirection mechanism, so you can use rules to redirect from and to any port. It also supports redirection to an external site as well.

__Session affinity__

The cookie-based session affinity feature is useful when you want to keep a user session on the same server. By using gateway-managed cookies, the Application Gateway can direct subsequent traffic from a user session to the same server for processing. This is important in cases where session state is saved locally on the server for a user session.

### VNet-to-VNet Connections

You can connect your VNets with a VNet-to-VNet VPN connection. Using this connection method, you create a VPN gateway in each virtual network. A secure tunnel using IPsec/IKE provides the communication between the networks.

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/9b34b00a1b5b2504950aedd475c03c0b/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.2+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ103_VNettoVNet.png)

With a VNet-to-VNet connection your VNets can be:

in the same or different regions.
in the same or different subscriptions.
in the same or different deployment models.
in Azure or on-premises.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SmithMMTK/home/master/Assets/VNET-to-VNET.png)

Before creating a __virtual network gateway__ for your virtual network, you first need to create the gateway subnet. The gateway subnet contains the IP addresses that are used by the virtual network gateway. If possible, it's best to create a gateway subnet by using a CIDR block of /28 or /27 to provide enough IP addresses to accommodate future additional configuration requirements.

__About policy-based and route-based VPN gateways__

Policy- vs. route-based VPN devices differ in how the IPsec traffic selectors are set on a connection:

__VPN Types__ ([more detail...](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateway-settings#vpntype))

When you create the virtual network gateway for a VPN gateway configuration, you must specify a VPN type. The VPN type that you choose depends on the connection topology that you want to create. For example, a P2S connection requires a RouteBased VPN type. A VPN type can also depend on the hardware that you are using. S2S configurations require a VPN device. Some VPN devices only support a certain VPN type.

Once a virtual network gateway has been created, you can't change the VPN type. You have to delete the virtual network gateway and create a new one. There are two VPN types:

- __PolicyBased:__ PolicyBased VPNs were previously called static routing gateways in the classic deployment model. Policy-based VPNs encrypt and direct packets through IPsec tunnels based on the IPsec policies configured with the combinations of address prefixes between your on-premises network and the Azure VNet. The policy (or traffic selector) is usually defined as an access list in the VPN device configuration. The value for a PolicyBased VPN type is PolicyBased. When using a PolicyBased VPN, keep in mind the following limitations:
    - PolicyBased VPNs can __only__ be used on the Basic gateway SKU. This VPN type is not compatible with other gateway SKUs.
    - You can have only 1 tunnel when using a PolicyBased VPN.
    - You can only use PolicyBased VPNs for S2S connections, and only for certain configurations. Most VPN Gateway configurations require a RouteBased VPN.
- __RouteBased:__ RouteBased VPNs were previously called dynamic routing gateways in the classic deployment model. RouteBased VPNs use "routes" in the IP forwarding or routing table to direct packets into their corresponding tunnel interfaces. The tunnel interfaces then encrypt or decrypt the packets in and out of the tunnels. The policy (or traffic selector) for RouteBased VPNs are configured as any-to-any (or wild cards). The value for a RouteBased VPN type is RouteBased.
