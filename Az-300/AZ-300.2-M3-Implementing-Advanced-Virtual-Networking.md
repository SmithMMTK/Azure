The Azure Load Balancer delivers high availability and network performance to your applications. It is an OSI Layer 4 (TCP and UDP) load balancer that distributes inbound traffic to backend resources using load balancing rules and health probes. Load balancing rules determine how traffic is distributed to the backend. Health probes ensure the resources in the backend are healthy.

There are two types of load balancers: __public__ and __internal__.

A public load balancer maps the public IP address and port number of incoming traffic to the private IP address and port number of the VM, and vice versa for the response traffic from the VM. By applying load-balancing rules, you can distribute specific types of traffic across multiple VMs or services. For example, you can spread the load of incoming web request traffic across multiple web servers.

An internal load balancer directs traffic only to resources that are inside a virtual network or that use a VPN to access Azure infrastructure. Frontend IP addresses and virtual networks are never directly exposed to an internet endpoint. Internal line-of-business applications run in Azure and are accessed from within Azure or from on-premises resources. For example, an internal load balancer could receive database requests that need to be distributed to backend SQL servers

__Load Balancer SKUs__

When you create an Azure Load Balancer you will select for the type (Internal or Public) of load balancer. You will also select the SKU. The load balancer supports both Basic and Standard SKUs, each differing in scenario scale, features, and pricing. The Standard Load Balancer is the newer Load Balancer product with an expanded and more granular feature set over Basic Load Balancer. It is a superset of Basic Load Balancer.
> SKUs are not mutable. You may not change the SKU of an existing resource

__Backend Pool__

-	| Standard SKU	| Basic SKU
--- | --- | --- 
Backend pool endpoints	| Any VM in a single virtual network, including a blend of VMs, availability sets, and VM scale sets.	| VMs in a single availability set or VM scale set.

__Load Balancer Rules__

Load balancing rules can be used in combination with NAT rules. For example, you could NAT TCP from the load balancer’s public address to TCP 3389 on a specific virtual machine. This allows remote desktop access from outside of Azure. Notice in this case, the NAT rule is explicitly attached to a VM (or network interface) to complete the path to the target; whereas a Load Balancing rule need not be.

__Multiple Frontends__
Azure Load Balancer allows you to load balance services on multiple ports, multiple IP addresses, or both. You can use public and internal load balancer definitions to load balance flows across a set of VMs. Adding multiple frontends is incremental to a single frontend configuration.

When you define an Azure Load Balancer, frontend and backend pool configurations are connected with rules. There are two types of rules:

1. The default rule with no backend port reuse
2. The Floating IP rule where backend ports are reused

__Session Persistence__
By default, Azure Load Balancer distributes network traffic equally among multiple VM instances. The load balancer uses a 5-tuple (source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, and protocol type) hash to map traffic to available servers. It provides stickiness only within a transport session.

__Health Probes__
A health probe allows the load balancer to monitor the status of your app. The health probe dynamically adds or removes VMs from the load balancer rotation based on their response to health checks. When a probe fails to respond, the load balancer stops sending new connections to the unhealthy instances.
There are two main ways to configure health probes: __HTTP__ and __TCP__.

HTTP custom probe****. The load balancer regularly probes your endpoint (every 15 seconds, by default). The instance is healthy if it responds with an HTTP 200 within the timeout period (default of 31 seconds). Any status other than HTTP 200 causes this probe to fail. You can specify the port (Port), the URI for requesting the health status from the backend (URI), amount of time between probe attempts (Interval), and the number of failures that must occur for the instance to be considered unhealthy (Unhealthy threshold).

TCP custom probe. This probe relies on establishing a successful TCP session to a defined probe port. If the specified listener on the VM exists, the probe succeeds. If the connection is refused, the probe fails. You can specify the Port, Interval, and Unhealthy threshold.

### Azure Application Gateway

Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications.

Traditional load balancers operate at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP) and route traffic based on source IP address and port, to a destination IP address and port. An example is the Azure Load Balancer. But the __Application Gateway is an OSI layer 7 load balancer__, so you can be even more specific in routing your network traffic.

The Application Gateway has many of the same components and configuration tasks as the Load Balancer. But, the terminology is a little different, so let’s review

__Web application firewall (WAF)__. A WAF is provided as part of the Application gateway. WAF integration makes security management much simpler and can react faster to a security threat by patching a known vulnerability at a central location versus securing each of the individual web applications.

__Web Application Firewall__

The Azure Application Gateway WAF provides protection for web applications. The WAF uses OWASP rules to protect your application. These rules include protection against attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting attacks, and session hijacks.

__Health Probes__

By default, Azure Application Gateway monitors the health of all resources in its backend pool and automatically removes any resource considered unhealthy from the pool. Application Gateway continues to monitor the unhealthy instances and adds them back to the healthy backend pool once they become available and respond to health probes.

For example, if you have two backend servers receiving HTTP network traffic on port 80, the default health probe checks every 30 seconds for a healthy HTTP response code between 200-399.

__Application Gateway Sizing__

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/d4e7666f7535d480dad203f8e325b4e6/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.2+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-101.3_Implementing_Advanced_Virtual_Networking_image36.png)

Each SKU provides different performance benefits. The following table shows the average performance throughput based on the backend page size. These are estimates, with SSL offload enabled.

Average back-end page response size	| Small	| Medium	| Large
--- | --- | --- | ---
6KB	| 7.5 Mbps	| 13 Mbps	| 50 Mbps
100KB	| 35 Mbps	| 100 Mbps	| 200 Mbps

We recommend a minimum instance count of __two for production workloads__. Azure distributes instances across update and fault domains to ensure that all instances do not fail at the same time. Your virtual network and public IP address must be in the same location as your gateway.
