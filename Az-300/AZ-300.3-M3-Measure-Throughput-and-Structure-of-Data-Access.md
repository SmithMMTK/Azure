## Module 3 - Measure Throughput and Structure of Data Access  

### Address Durability of Data anc Caching

__Data Concurrency__

__ACID__

The acronym ACID stands for atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable. To ensure predictable behavior, all transactions must possess these basic properties, reinforcing the role of mission-critical transactions as all-or-none propositions:

A transaction in a database system is a set of operations, which are related, that seek to achieve some or all the ACID properties. In most relational database management systems (RDBMS), a transaction is a single unit of work. If a transaction is successful, all of the data modifications made during the transaction are committed and become a permanent part of the database. The database system erases all data modifications based on that transaction if a transaction encounters any errors or must be rolled back for another reason.

__Caching in distributed applications__

Caching is a common technique that aims to improve the performance and scalability of a system. It does this by temporarily copying frequently accessed data to fast storage that's located close to the application. If this fast data storage is located closer to the application than the original source, then caching can significantly improve response times for client applications by serving data more quickly.

### Measure Throughput and Structure of Data Access

__Normalized Units__

In a world of hyperscale database services, it can be difficult to determine how much performance you need or how powerful an allocated database is. To help ease this challenge, many cloud vendors have provided normalized units of measurements that can be used to compare database tiers. Sometimes these units of measurement have a direct relation to on-premises database equivalents, but it is simpler to think of them as relative performance guarantees.

For example, if your application uses 20 database units today, 40 database units will guarantee you approximately double your performance, while 10 database units will guarantee you half of your performance.

__DTUs – Azure SQL Database__

In Azure SQL Database, we measure database performance in terms of database throughput units (DTUs). The DTU model is based on a bundled measure of compute, storage, and IO resources. Performance levels are expressed in terms of database transaction units (DTUs) for single databases and elastic database transaction units (eDTUs) for elastic pools.

DTUs describe the capacity for a specific tier and performance level, and they are designed to be relative so that you can directly compare the tiers and performance levels. For example, the Basic tier has a single performance level (B) that is rated at 5 DTU. The S2 performance level in the Standard tier is rated at 50 DTU. This means that you can expect ten times the power for a database at the S2 performance level than a database at the B performance level in the Basic tier.

The easiest way to visualize a DTU is to think about it in the context of a bounding box. The box represents the relative power (or resources) assigned to the database. This relative power is a natural blended measurement of the central processing unit (CPU), memory, and read-write performance.


__RUs – Azure Cosmos DB__

Azure Cosmos DB reserves resources to manage the throughput of an application. Because, application load and access patterns change over time, Azure Cosmos DB has support built-in to increase or decrease the amount of reserved throughput available at any time.

With Azure Cosmos DB, reserved throughput is specified in terms of __request unit processing per second (RU/s)__. You reserve several guaranteed request units to be available to your application on a per-second basis. Each operation in Azure Cosmos DB, including writing a document, performing a query, and updating a document, consumes CPU, memory, and Input/output operations per second (IOPS). That is, each operation incurs a request charge, which is expressed in request units.

A request unit is a normalized measure of request processing cost. A single request unit represents the processing capacity that’s required to read, via self-link or ID, a single item that is 1 kilobyte (KB) and that consists of 10 unique property values (excluding system properties). A request to create (insert), replace, or delete the same item consumes more processing from the service and thereby requires more request units.
