## Module 3 - Using Azure Kubernetes Service  

### Creating an Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster

__Kubernetes cluster architecture__

A Kubernetes cluster is divided into two components:

- __Cluster master nodes__ provide the core Kubernetes services and orchestration of application workloads.
- __Nodes__ run your application workloads.

__Cluster master__

When you create an AKS cluster, a cluster master is automatically created and configured. This cluster master is provided as a managed Azure resource abstracted from the user. There is _no cost for the cluster master_, only the nodes that are part of the AKS cluster.

The cluster master includes the following core Kubernetes components:

- __kube-apiserver__ - The API server is how the underlying Kubernetes APIs are exposed. This component provides the interaction for management tools, such as kubectl or the Kubernetes dashboard.
- __etcd__ - To maintain the state of your Kubernetes cluster and configuration, the highly available etcd is a key value store within Kubernetes.
- __kube-scheduler__ - When you create or scale applications, the Scheduler determines what nodes can run the workload and starts them.
- __kube-controller-manager__ - The Controller Manager oversees a number of smaller Controllers that perform actions such as replicating pods and handling node operations.

AKS provides a single-tenant cluster master, with a dedicated API server, Scheduler, etc. You define the number and size of the nodes, and the Azure platform configures the secure communication between the cluster master and nodes. Interaction with the cluster master occurs through Kubernetes APIs, such as __kubectl__ or the Kubernetes dashboard.

This managed cluster master means that you do not need to configure components like a highly available etcd store, but it also means that you cannot access the cluster master directly. Upgrades to Kubernetes are orchestrated through the Azure CLI or Azure portal, which upgrades the cluster master and then the nodes. To troubleshoot possible issues, you can review the cluster master logs through Azure Log Analytics.

If you need to configure the cluster master in a particular way or need direct access to them, you can deploy your own Kubernetes cluster using __aks-engine__.

__Nodes and node pools__

To run your applications and supporting services, you need a Kubernetes node. An AKS cluster has one or more nodes, which is an Azure virtual machine (VM) that runs the Kubernetes node components and container runtime:

- The kubelet is the Kubernetes agent that processes the orchestration requests from the cluster master and scheduling of running the requested containers.
- Virtual networking is handled by the kube-proxy on each node. The proxy routes network traffic and manages IP addressing for services and pods.
- The container runtime is the component that allows containerized applications to run and interact with additional resources such as the virtual network and storage. In AKS, Docker is used as the container runtime.
