## Module 3 - Using Azure Kubernetes Service  

### Creating an Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster

__Kubernetes cluster architecture__

A Kubernetes cluster is divided into two components:

- __Cluster master nodes__ provide the core Kubernetes services and orchestration of application workloads.
- __Nodes__ run your application workloads.

__Cluster master__

When you create an AKS cluster, a cluster master is automatically created and configured. This cluster master is provided as a managed Azure resource abstracted from the user. There is _no cost for the cluster master_, only the nodes that are part of the AKS cluster.

The cluster master includes the following core Kubernetes components:

- __kube-apiserver__ - The API server is how the underlying Kubernetes APIs are exposed. This component provides the interaction for management tools, such as kubectl or the Kubernetes dashboard.
- __etcd__ - To maintain the state of your Kubernetes cluster and configuration, the highly available etcd is a key value store within Kubernetes.
- __kube-scheduler__ - When you create or scale applications, the Scheduler determines what nodes can run the workload and starts them.
- __kube-controller-manager__ - The Controller Manager oversees a number of smaller Controllers that perform actions such as replicating pods and handling node operations.

AKS provides a single-tenant cluster master, with a dedicated API server, Scheduler, etc. You define the number and size of the nodes, and the Azure platform configures the secure communication between the cluster master and nodes. Interaction with the cluster master occurs through Kubernetes APIs, such as __kubectl__ or the Kubernetes dashboard.

This managed cluster master means that you do not need to configure components like a highly available etcd store, but it also means that you cannot access the cluster master directly. Upgrades to Kubernetes are orchestrated through the Azure CLI or Azure portal, which upgrades the cluster master and then the nodes. To troubleshoot possible issues, you can review the cluster master logs through Azure Log Analytics.

If you need to configure the cluster master in a particular way or need direct access to them, you can deploy your own Kubernetes cluster using __aks-engine__.

__Nodes and node pools__

To run your applications and supporting services, you need a Kubernetes node. An AKS cluster has one or more nodes, which is an Azure virtual machine (VM) that runs the Kubernetes node components and container runtime:

- The kubelet is the Kubernetes agent that processes the orchestration requests from the cluster master and scheduling of running the requested containers.
- Virtual networking is handled by the kube-proxy on each node. The proxy routes network traffic and manages IP addressing for services and pods.
- The container runtime is the component that allows containerized applications to run and interact with additional resources such as the virtual network and storage. In AKS, Docker is used as the container runtime.

The Azure VM size for your nodes defines how many CPUs, how much memory, and the size and type of storage available (such as high-performance SSD or regular HDD). If you anticipate a need for applications that require large amounts of CPU and memory or high-performance storage, plan the node size accordingly. You can also scale up the number of nodes in your AKS cluster to meet demand.

In AKS, the VM image for the nodes in your cluster is currently based on Ubuntu Linux. When you create an AKS cluster or scale up the number of nodes, the Azure platform creates the requested number of VMs and configures them. There is no manual configuration for you to perform.

If you need to use a different host OS, container runtime, or include custom packages, you can deploy your own Kubernetes cluster using aks-engine. The upstream aks-engine releases features and provide configuration options before they are officially supported in AKS clusters. For example, if you wish to use Windows containers or a container runtime other than Docker, you can use aks-engine to configure and deploy a Kubernetes cluster that meets your current needs.

__Resource reservations__

You don't need to manage the core Kubernetes components on each node, such as the kubelet, kube-proxy, and kube-dns, but they do consume some of the available compute resources. To maintain node performance and functionality, the following compute resources are reserved on each node:

- CPU - 60ms
- Memory - 20% up to 4 GiB

These reservations mean that the amount of available CPU and memory for your applications may appear less than the node itself contains. If there are resource constraints due to the number of applications that you run, these reservations ensure CPU and memory remains available for the core Kubernetes components. The resource reservations cannot be changed.

__Node pools__

Nodes of the same configuration are grouped together into node pools. A Kubernetes cluster contains one or more node pools. The initial number of nodes and size are defined when you create an AKS cluster, which creates a default node pool. This default node pool in AKS contains the underlying VMs that run your agent nodes.

When you scale or upgrade an AKS cluster, the action is performed against the default node pool. For upgrade operations, running containers are scheduled on other nodes in the node pool until all the nodes are successfully upgraded.

__Pods__

Kubernetes uses pods to run an instance of your application. A pod represents a single instance of your application. Pods typically have a 1:1 mapping with a container, although there are advanced scenarios where a pod may contain multiple containers. These multi-container pods are scheduled together on the same node, and allow containers to share related resources.

When you create a pod, you can define resource limits to request a certain amount of CPU or memory resources. The Kubernetes Scheduler tries to schedule the pods to run on a node with available resources to meet the request. You can also specify maximum resource limits that prevent a given pod from consuming too much compute resource from the underlying node. A best practice is to include resource limits for all pods to help the Kubernetes Scheduler understand what resources are needed and permitted.

A pod is a logical resource, but the container(s) are where the application workloads run. Pods are typically ephemeral, disposable resources, and individually scheduled pods miss some of the high availability and redundancy features Kubernetes provides. Instead, pods are usually deployed and managed by Kubernetes Controllers, such as the Deployment Controller.

__Deployments and YAML manifests__

A deployment represents one or more identical pods, managed by the Kubernetes Deployment Controller. A deployment defines the number of replicas (pods) to create, and the Kubernetes Scheduler ensures that if pods or nodes encounter problems, additional pods are scheduled on healthy nodes.

You can update deployments to change the configuration of pods, container image used, or attached storage. The Deployment Controller drains and terminates a given number of replicas, creates replicas from the new deployment definition, and continues the process until all replicas in the deployment are updated.

Most stateless applications in AKS should use the deployment model rather than scheduling individual pods. Kubernetes can monitor the health and status of deployments to ensure that the required number of replicas run within the cluster. When you only schedule individual pods, the pods are not restarted if they encounter a problem, and are not rescheduled on healthy nodes if their current node encounters a problem.

If an application requires a quorum of instances to always be available for management decisions to be made, you don't want an update process to disrupt that ability. Pod Disruption Budgets can be used to define how many replicas in a deployment can be taken down during an update or node upgrade. For example, if you have 5 replicas in your deployment, you can define a pod disruption of 4 to only permit one replica from being deleted/rescheduled at a time. As with pod resource limits, a best practice is to define pod disruption budgets on applications that require a minimum number of replicas to always be present.

Deployments are typically created and managed with kubectl create or kubectl apply. To create a deployment, you define a manifest file in the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) format. The following example creates a basic deployment of the NGINX web server. The deployment specifies 3 replicas to be created, and that port 80 be open on the container. Resource requests and limits are also defined for CPU and memory.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.15.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 250m
            memory: 64Mi
          limits:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 256Mi
```

More complex applications can be created by also including services such as load balancers within the YAML manifest.

__Package management with Helm__

A common approach to managing applications in Kubernetes is with Helm. You can build and use existing public Helm charts that contain a packaged version of application code and Kubernetes YAML manifests to deploy resources. These Helm charts can be stored locally, or often in a remote repository, such as an Azure Container Registry Helm chart repo.

To use Helm, a server component called Tiller is installed in your Kubernetes cluster. The Tiller manages the installation of charts within the cluster. The Helm client itself is installed locally on your computer, or can be used within the Azure Cloud Shell. You can search for or create Helm charts with the client, and then install them to your Kubernetes cluster.
