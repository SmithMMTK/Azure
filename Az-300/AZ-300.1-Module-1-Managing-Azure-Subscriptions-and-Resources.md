__Azure Monitor provides three main capabilities.__

- __Monitor and visualize metrics__. Metrics are numerical values available from Azure resources helping you understand the health, operation and performance of your system.

- __Query and analyze logs__. Logs are activity logs, diagnostic logs, and telemetry from monitoring solutions; analytics queries help with troubleshooting and visualizations.

- __Setup alerts and actions__. Alerts notify you of critical conditions and potentially take automated corrective actions based on triggers from metrics or logs.


__Data Types__

- __Application monitoring data__: Data about the performance and functionality of "*the code you have written*".

- __Guest OS monitoring data__: Data about "_the operating system_" on which your application is running.

- __Azure__
    - __Azure resource monitoring data__: Data about the operation of an Azure resource.

    - __Azure subscription monitoring data__: Data about the operation and management of an Azure subscription, as well as data about the health and operation of Azure itself.

    - __Azure tenant monitoring data__: Data about the operation of tenant-level Azure services, such as Azure Active Directory.

Alert rules are separated from __alerts__ and __the actions__ that are taken when an alert fires. The alert rule captures the target and criteria for alerting. The alert rule can be in an _"enabled"_ or a _"disabled"_ state. Alerts only fire when enabled. The key attributes of an alert rule are:

- __Target Resource__ – Defines the scope and signals available for alerting.
> A target can be any Azure resource e.g.:
> - Virtual machine
>- Storage account
>- Virtual machine scale set
>- Log Analytics workspace
>- Application Insights resource. 
>
>For certain resources (like Virtual Machines), you can specify multiple resources as the target of the alert rule.

__Signal__ – Signals are emitted by the target resource and can be of several types. Metric, Activity log, Application Insights, and Log.
__Criteria__ – Criteria is a combination of Signal and Logic applied on a Target resource.
>Example: 
> Percentage CPU > 70%; Server Response Time > 4 ms; and Result count of a log query > 100.

__Alert Name__ – A specific name for the alert rule configured by the user.
__Alert Description__ – A description for the alert rule configured by the user.
__Severity__ – The severity of the alert once the criteria specified in the alert rule is met. Severity can range from 0 to 4.
__Action__ – A specific action taken when the alert is fired. See the Action Groups topic coming up.

> You may have up to 10 Azure app actions in an Action Group. At this time the Azure app action only supports ServiceHealth alerts.

__Managing Alerts__
State	| Description
--- | ---
New	| The issue has just been detected and has not yet been reviewed.
Acknowledged | An administrator has reviewed the alert and started working on it.
Closed | The issue has been resolved. After an alert has been closed, you can reopen it by changing it to another state.

### Activity Log
The Azure Activity Log is a subscription log that provides insight into subscription-level events that have occurred in Azure.

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/eaa160a5ff5e04c2671657a3a4879f71/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.1_Subscriptions_and_Resources_image40.png)


_With the Activity Log, you can determine the ‘what, who, and when’ for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) taken on the resources in your subscription._

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/ce02dd3bc70644c739c728160039f737/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ103_Activity_Log.png)


The Activity Log differs from Diagnostic Logs. 
- Activity Logs provide data about the operations on a resource from the outside (the “__control plane__”). 
- Diagnostics Logs are emitted by a resource and provide information about the operation of that resource (the "__data plane__").

>Activity logs are __kept for 90 days__. You can query for any range of dates, as long as the starting date isn't more than 90 days in the past. You can retrieve events from your Activity Log using the Azure portal, CLI, PowerShell cmdlets, and Azure Monitor REST API.

__Query the Activity Log__

__Event Categories__
The Activity Log provides several event categories. You may select one or more.

- __Administrative__. This category contains the record of all create, update, delete, and action operations performed through Resource Manager
    > "Who create VM"

- __Service Health__. This category contains the record of any service health incidents that have occurred in Azure.
    > "SQL Azure in SEA experiencing downtime"

- __Alert__. This category contains the record of all activations of Azure alerts.
    > “CPU % on myVM has been over 80 for the past 5 minutes”

- __Autoscale__. This category contains the record of any events related to the operation of the autoscale engine based on any autoscale settings you have defined in your subscription.
    > "An example of the type of event you would see in this category is “Autoscale scale up action failed”

- __Recommendation__. This category contains recommendation events from certain resource types, such as web sites and SQL servers. These events offer recommendations for how to better utilize your resources.

- __Security__. This category contains the record of any alerts generated by Azure Security Center.
    > “Suspicious double extension file executed”

- __Policy__ and Resource Health. These categories do not contain any events; they are reserved for future use.

### Management Groups 
![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/fbb985147ed556b1a69c4a3e68b1f47b/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ103_Management_Groups.png)

All subscriptions within a management group __automatically inherit__ the conditions applied to the management group. For example, you can apply policies to a management group that limits the regions available for virtual machine (VM) creation. This policy would be applied to all management groups, subscriptions, and resources under that management group by only allowing VMs to be created in that region.

```powershell
    New-AzManagementGroup -GroupName 'Contoso' -DisplayName 'Contoso Development'
```

__Azure Subscriptions__
![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/3b4484ecff7278f84e43c99af0880242/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ103_Azure_Subscriptions.png)

__Subscription User Types__
Administrative role |	Limit	|   Summary
--- | --- | ---
Account Administrator | 1 per Azure account | Authorized to access the Account Center (create subscriptions, cancel subscriptions, change billing for a subscription, change Service Administrator). This role has full control over the subscription and is the account that is responsible for billing. __The Account Administrator does not have any other access to services in that subscription__
Service Administrator | 1 per Azure subscription | Authorized to access Azure Management Portal for all subscriptions in the account. By default, same as the Account Administrator when a subscription is created. __This role has control over all the services in the subscription__.
Co-Administrator | 200 per subscription (in addition to Service Administrator) | Same as Service Administrator but can’t change the association of subscriptions to Azure directories.

__Check Resource Limits__

__Billing Alerts__ help you monitor and manage billing activity for your Azure accounts. Billing alerts is available from the Account portal. You can set up a total of five billing alerts per subscription, with a different threshold and up to two email recipients for each alert. Monthly budgets are evaluated against spending every four hours. Budgets reset automatically at the end of a period.

__Reservations__ helps you save money by pre-paying for one-year or three-years of virtual machine, SQL Database compute capacity, Azure Cosmos DB throughput, or other Azure resources. Pre-paying allows you to get a discount on the resources you use. Reservations can significantly reduce your virtual machine, SQL database compute, Azure Cosmos DB, or other resource costs up to 72% on pay-as-you-go prices. Reservations provide a billing discount and don't affect the runtime state of your resources.
