### Managing Web Apps

__Backup Your App__

__Restore a Backup__

__Restore a Snapshot__

If your app is running in the Premium tier or higher, the platform automatically saves snapshots for data recovery purposes. Snapshots are incremental shadow copies that have several advantages over backups:

- No file copy errors due to file locks.
- No storage size limitation.
- No configuration required.

### App Service Security

__App Service Security Levels__

The Azure App Service has two security levels.

- __Infrastructure and platform security__. You trust Azure to provide an infrastructure and platform to securely run your services.

- __Application security__. You design an app with security features. This includes how you integrate with Azure Active Directory, how you manage certificates, and how you make sure that you can securely communicate with different services.

    While Azure is responsible for securing the infrastructure and platform that your application runs on, it is your responsibility to secure your application itself. In other words, you need to develop, deploy, and manage your application code and content in a secure way. Without this, your application code or content can still be vulnerable to threats such as:

    - __SQL Injection__. SQL injection is an attack in which malicious code is inserted into strings that are later passed to an instance of SQL Server for parsing and execution. Any procedure that constructs SQL statements should be reviewed for injection vulnerabilities because SQL Server will execute all syntactically valid queries that it receives. Even parameterized data can be manipulated by a skilled and determined attacker.

    - __Session hijacking__. There are two types of session hijacking depending on how they are done. If the attacker directly gets involved with the target, it is called active hijacking, and if an attacker just passively monitors the traffic, it is passive hijacking.

    - __Cross-site-scripting__. Cross site scripting attacks work by embedding script tags in URLs and enticing users to click them, ensuring that the malicious script gets executed on the user's computer. These attacks leverage the trust between the user and the server and the fact that there is no input/output validation on the server to reject script language characters. Most browsers are installed with the capability to run scripts enabled by default.

    - __Application level Man-In-the-Middle (MITM)__. A MITM attack occurs when an attacker reroutes communication between two users through the attackerâ€™s computer without the knowledge of the two communicating users. The attacker can monitor and read the traffic before sending it on to the intended recipient.
