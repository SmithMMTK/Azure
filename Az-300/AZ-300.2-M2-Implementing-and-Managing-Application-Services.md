__Restore a Snapshot__

If your app is running in the Premium tier or higher, the platform automatically saves snapshots for data recovery purposes. Snapshots are incremental shadow copies that have several advantages over backups:

- No file copy errors due to file locks.
- No storage size limitation.
- No configuration required.

### App Service Security

__App Service Security Levels__

The Azure App Service has two security levels.

- __Infrastructure and platform security__. You trust Azure to provide an infrastructure and platform to securely run your services.

- __Application security__. You design an app with security features. This includes how you integrate with Azure Active Directory, how you manage certificates, and how you make sure that you can securely communicate with different services.

    While Azure is responsible for securing the infrastructure and platform that your application runs on, it is your responsibility to secure your application itself. In other words, you need to develop, deploy, and manage your application code and content in a secure way. Without this, your application code or content can still be vulnerable to threats such as:

    - __SQL Injection__. SQL injection is an attack in which malicious code is inserted into strings that are later passed to an instance of SQL Server for parsing and execution. Any procedure that constructs SQL statements should be reviewed for injection vulnerabilities because SQL Server will execute all syntactically valid queries that it receives. Even parameterized data can be manipulated by a skilled and determined attacker.

    - __Session hijacking__. There are two types of session hijacking depending on how they are done. If the attacker directly gets involved with the target, it is called active hijacking, and if an attacker just passively monitors the traffic, it is passive hijacking.

    - __Cross-site-scripting__. Cross site scripting attacks work by embedding script tags in URLs and enticing users to click them, ensuring that the malicious script gets executed on the user's computer. These attacks leverage the trust between the user and the server and the fact that there is no input/output validation on the server to reject script language characters. Most browsers are installed with the capability to run scripts enabled by default.

    - __Application level Man-In-the-Middle (MITM)__. A MITM attack occurs when an attacker reroutes communication between two users through the attacker’s computer without the knowledge of the two communicating users. The attacker can monitor and read the traffic before sending it on to the intended recipient.

__App Service Authentication__

To sign in a user by using one of these providers, the user must be redirected to an endpoint that signs in users for that provider. If customers are using a web browser, you can have App Service automatically direct all unauthenticated users to the endpoint that signs in users. Otherwise, you will need to direct your customers to:

__{ your App Service base URL } /.auth/login/< provider >__

where __< provider >__ is one of the following values: AAD, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or Twitter.

For other client types, such as mobile, __a JSON web token (JWT)__, which should be presented in the __X-ZUMO-AUTH__ header, will be issued to the client. The Mobile Apps client SDKs will handle this for you

__Authentication Providers__
The App Service supports five identity providers out of the box: Azure Active Directory, Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account, and Twitter

### Serverless Computing Concepts

Serverless computing is the abstraction of servers, infrastructure, and operating systems. When building serverless apps, developers don’t need to provision and manage any servers, and can take their minds off infrastructure concerns.

__Serverless Applications__

__Compute__

- __Azure Functions__ is an event-driven compute experience that allows an app developer to execute code, written in the programming language of their choice, without worrying about servers. An organization benefits from scale on demand without incurring charges for idle capacity.

__Cloud Messaging__

- __Event Grid__ is a fully managed event routing service that enables rich application scenarios by connecting serverless logic to events coming from multiple Azure services or from a developer or organization’s custom apps.

- __Service Bus__ is a fully managed messaging infrastructure that enables an organization to build distributed and scalable cloud solutions with connections across private and public cloud environments.

__Workflow Orchestration__

- __Logic Apps__ provide serverless workflows that allow developers to easily integrate data with their apps instead of writing complex glue code between disparate systems. Logic Apps also allow the orchestration and connecting of the serverless functions and APIs in an application.

__Azure Functions vs Logic Apps__

Comparison | Durable Functions | Logic Apps
--- | --- | ---
Development | Code-first (imperative) | Designer-first (declarative)
Connectivity	| About a dozen built-in binding types, write code for custom bindings	| Large collection of connectors, Enterprise Integration Pack for B2B scenarios, build custom connectors
Actions	| Each activity is an Azure function; write code for activity functions	| Large collection of ready-made actions
Monitoring	| Azure Application Insights	| Azure portal, Operations Management Suite, Log Analytics
Management	| REST API, Visual Studio	| Azure portal, REST API, PowerShell, Visual Studio
Execution context	| Can run locally or in the cloud.	| Runs only in the cloud.

__Functions and WebJobs__

Comparison | Functions | WebJobs with WebJobs SDK
--- | --- | ---
Serverless app model with automatic scaling	| Yes	| No
Develop and test in browser	| Yes	| No
Pay-per-use pricing	| Yes	| No
Integration with Logic Apps	| Yes	| No

### Managing Azure Functions

__Overview of Azure Functions__

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables you to run code on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure.

Serverless relieves the developer from the operational complexity of running applications. He or she no longer must worry about servers, virtual machines, patching, and scaling. This differs slightly from PaaS, because with PaaS, you still need to choose your operating system and the VM size, which means you need to be able to forecast your demand and then pay for that capacity, even if it's not fully utilized.

With serverless, Azure has compute resources ready to be allocated. Their usage is triggered by an event. The developer provides the code and when an event occurs, such as an Azure alert or when a message is received, Azure provisions the necessary compute resources. This is activity-based billing, so a developer, or the organization, only incurs charges when using the resources.

When you create a function app, you must decide on a name, OS, and hosting plan. There are two hosting plans: __Consumption Plan__ and __App Service Plan__. Choose the one that best fits your needs.

- __App Service plan__ : A developer can run their functions just like any web, mobile, and API apps. While already using App Service for your other applications, the developer can run those functions on the same plan at no additional cost. Currently, Linux hosting is currently only available on an App Service plan.

- __Consumption plan__ : When a function runs, Azure provides all the necessary compute resources. The developer or the organization doesn’t need to worry about resource management, and only pays for the time that the code runs.

The Consumption plan automatically scales CPU and memory resources by adding additional processing instances based on the runtime needs of the functions in the Function App. The Consumption plan is the default hosting plan and offers the following benefits:

__Function Templates__
After creating a function and selecting the service plan, a developer can use a template for many different key scenarios. The template will create a function triggered to different events. The trigger will start the execution of the code. Here are some example templates.
- HTTP Trigger
- BLOB Trigger
- Time Trigger

__Bindings__
So far you have learned that a trigger defines how a function is invoked. Bindings are a way to provide input and output to the function. For example, if the function is resizing an image then it could be bound to the incoming Blob storage. When an image arrives in that storage, a trigger would start the resizing function. The processed image could then be stored in the same or different Blob storage. A function can have multiple input and output bindings. Bindings are always optional.

__Function Scaling__

Azure Functions can scale to meet your needs. Azure Functions uses a component called the scale controller to monitor the rate of events and determine whether to scale out (add host instances) or scale in (remove host instances).

The scale controller uses heuristics for each trigger type. For example, when you're using an Azure Queue storage trigger, it scales based on the queue length and the age of the oldest queue message.

### Managing Event Grid

__Overview of Event Grid__
Simplify event-based apps with Event Grid, a single service for managing routing of all events from any source to any destination. Designed for high availability, consistent performance, and dynamic scale, Event Grid lets a developer focus on the app logic rather than infrastructure. Here are a few advantages:

![atl](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/388f29de6da7066fbadbbad901279512/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.2+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-101.2_Implementing_and_Managing_Application_Services_image68.png)

- __Event Source__. An event source is where the event happens. Several Azure services are automatically configured to send events. For example, Azure Storage is the event source for blob created events. Developers can also create custom applications that send events. Custom applications do not need to be hosted in Azure to use Event Grid for event distribution.

- __Topic__. The event grid topic provides an endpoint where the source sends events. A topic is used for a collection of related events.

- __Event Subscription__. A subscription tells Event Grid which events on a topic you are interested in receiving. When creating the subscription, you provide an endpoint for handling the event. You can filter the events that are sent to the endpoint.

- __Event Handler__. An event handler is the place where the event is sent. The handler takes some further action to process the event. Event Grid supports multiple handler types. For example, Azure Automation, Queue Storage, and Logic Apps.

### Managing Service Bus

Azure Service Bus is a multi-tenant cloud messaging service that sends information between applications and services. The information is stored in a message queue. The asynchronous operations give you flexible, brokered messaging, along with structured processing, and publish/subscribe capabilities.
