## Module 4 - Implementing Authentication

### Implementing authentication in applications

__Certificate-based authentication__
Client certificate authentication enables each web-based client to establish its identity to a server by using a digital certificate, which provides additional security for user authentication


__Helping to secure back-end services__

Certificate-based authentication can be useful in scenarios where your organization has multiple front-end applications communicating with back-end services. Traditionally, the certificates are installed on each server, and the machines trust each other after validating certificates. This same traditional structure can be used for infrastructure in Azure.

__Azure AD__

Azure AD is an identity and access management cloud solution that provides directory services, identity governance, and application access management. Azure AD quickly enables single sign-on (SSO) to thousands of pre-integrated commercial and custom apps in the Azure AD application gallery.

__Understanding the difference between Active Directory Domain Services and Azure Active Directory__

Both Azure AD and Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) are systems that store directory data and manage communication between users and resources, including user logon processes, authentication, and directory searches.

- AD DS is a server role in Windows Server, which means that it can be deployed on physical machines or virtual machines (VMs). It has a hierarchical structure based on X.500. It uses DNS for locating objects, can be interacted with using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), and primarily uses Kerberos for authentication. Windows Server Active Directory enables organizational units (OUs) and Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in addition to joining machines to the domain, and trusts are created between domains.

- Azure AD is a multi-customer public directory service, which means that within Azure AD, you can create a tenant for your cloud servers and applications, such as Office 365. Users and groups are created in a flat structure without OUs or GPOs. Authentication is performed through protocols such as SAML, WS-Federation, and Open Authorization (OAuth). It's possible to query Azure AD, but instead of using LDAP, you must use a REST API called Azure AD Graph API. These all work over HTTP and HTTPS.

__Azure AD Connect__

Azure AD Connect integrates on-premises directories with Azure AD. This allows you to provide a common identity for enterprise users in Office 365, Azure, and software as a service (SaaS) applications.

Azure AD Connect is made up of three primary components: the synchronization services, the optional Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) component, and the monitoring component named Azure AD Connect Health.

- Synchronization - This component is responsible for creating users, groups, and other objects. It is also responsible for making sure identity information for your on-premises users and groups is matching the cloud.

- Active Directory Federation Services - Federation is an optional part of Azure AD Connect and can be used to configure a hybrid environment using an on-premises AD FS infrastructure. This can be used by organizations to address complex deployments, such as domain-join SSO, the enforcement of Azure AD sign-in policy, and smart card or third-party multi-factor authentication.

- Health monitoring - Azure AD Connect Health can provide robust monitoring and a central location in the Azure portal to view this activity.

Azure AD Connect comes with several features you can optionally turn on or that are enabled by default. Some features might sometimes require more configuration in certain scenarios and topologies.

- Filtering is used when you want to limit which objects are synchronized to Azure AD. By default, all users, contacts, groups, and Windows 10 computers are synchronized. You can change the filtering based on domains, OUs, or attributes.

- Password hash synchronization synchronizes the password hash in Active Directory to Azure AD. The end user can use the same password on-premises and in the cloud but only manage it in one location. Since it uses your on-premises Active Directory as the authority, you can also use your own password policy.

- Password writeback will allow your users to change and reset their passwords in the cloud and have your on-premises password policy applied.

- Device writeback will allow a device registered in Azure AD to be written back to on-premises Active Directory so it can be used for conditional access.

- The prevent accidental deletes feature is turned on by default and helps protect your cloud directory from numerous delete operations at the same time. By default, it allows 500 delete operations per run. You can change this setting depending on your organization size.

- Automatic upgrade is enabled by default for express settings installations and helps ensure that your Azure AD Connect is always up-to-date with the latest release.

### Implement multi-factor authentication

There are two ways to enable MFA:

- The first option is to __enable each user__ for MFA. When users are enabled individually, they perform two-step verification each time they sign in. There are a few exceptions, such as when they sign in from trusted IP addresses or when the remembered devices feature is turned on.

- The second option is to set up a __conditional access policy__ that requires two-step verification under certain conditions. This method uses the Azure AD Identity Protection risk policy to require two-step verification based only on the sign-in risk for all cloud applications.

Suppoted Methods:
- Call to phone
- SMS
- Mobile App Notification
- Mobile App Varidation code

### Claims-based authorization

__Note:__ The terms authentication and authorization can be confusing. To keep it simple, authentication is the act of verifying someone’s identity. When you authenticate someone, you are determining who they are. Authorization is the act of verifying that someone has access to a certain subsystem or operation. When you authorize someone, you are determining what they can do.

Claims-based authorization is an approach where the authorization decision to grant or deny access is based on arbitrary logic that uses data available in claims to make the decision. Claims-based authorization, at its simplest, checks the value of a claim and allows access to a resource based on that value. For example, if you want access to a night club, the authorization process might be:

The door security officer evaluates the value of your date of birth claim and whether they trust the issuer (the driving license authority) before granting you access.
In a relying party application, authorization determines what resources an authenticated identity is allowed to access and what operations it is allowed to perform on those resources. Improper or weak authorization leads to information disclosure and data tampering.

Claim-based authorization checks are declarative—the developer embeds them within their code, against a controller or an action within a controller, specifying claims that the current user must possess and optionally the value the claim must hold to access the requested resource. Claims requirements are policy based; the developer must build and register a policy expressing the claims requirements.

### Role-based access control (RBAC) authorization

Role-based authorization is an authorization approach in which user permissions are managed and enforced by an application based on user roles. If a user has a role that is required to perform an action, access is granted; otherwise, access is denied. When an identity is created, it may belong to one or more roles. For example, Holly may belong to the Administrator and User roles, whereas Adam may belong only to the User role. How these roles are created and managed depends on the backing store of the authorization process.

__How RBAC works__ ([detail](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview#how-rbac-works))

- Security principal : A security principal is an object that represents a user, group, service principal, or managed identity that is requesting access to Azure resources.

    ![Alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/media/overview/rbac-security-principal.png)

- Role definition : A role definition is a collection of permissions. It's sometimes just called a role. A role definition lists the operations that can be performed, such as read, write, and delete. Roles can be high-level, like owner, or specific, like virtual machine reader

    ![Alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/media/overview/rbac-role-definition.png)

- Scope : Scope is the set of resources that the access applies to. When you assign a role, you can further limit the actions allowed by defining a scope. 

    ![Alt text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/media/overview/rbac-scope.png)

- Role assignments : A role assignment is the process of attaching a role definition to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity at a particular scope for the purpose of granting access. Access is granted by creating a role assignment, and access is revoked by removing a role assignment

```bash
    az role definition create --role-definition customrole.json
    
    az role assignment create --role "App Svc Contributor" 
        --assignee-object-id "GUID"
        --assignee "user/group"
```

```json
    {
        "Actions" : [ ],
        "NotActions" : [ ],
        "DataActions" : [ 
            "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/delete",
            "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/read",
            "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/write"],
        "NoDataActions" : [ "Exclusion" ]
    }

```

### Implement OAuth2 authentication

OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. OAuth 2.0 defines mechanisms to obtain and use access tokens to access protected resources, but they do not define standard methods to provide identity information. OpenID Connect implements authentication as an extension to the OAuth 2.0 authorization process. It provides information about the end user in the form of an id_token that verifies the identity of the user and provides basic profile information about the user.

### Implement managed identities for Azure resources

A common challenge when building cloud applications is how to manage the credentials in your code for authenticating to cloud services. Keeping the credentials secure is an important task. Ideally, the credentials never appear on developer workstations and aren't checked into source control. Azure Key Vault provides a way to securely store credentials, secrets, and other keys, but your code has to authenticate to Key Vault to retrieve them.

The managed identities for Azure resources feature in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) solves this problem. The feature provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure AD. You can use the identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, including Key Vault, without any credentials in your code.

The managed identities for Azure resources feature is free with Azure AD for Azure subscriptions. There's no additional cost.

Note: Managed identities for Azure resources is the new name for the service formerly known as Managed Service Identity (MSI).


The feature provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure AD. You can use the identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, including Key Vault, without any credentials in your code.

Quick-Steps ([detail:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/tutorial-windows-vm-access-arm))
- Add role assignment (__Reader__) to __all resource groups__
- Use __Invoke__ cmdlet to get access token
    ```powershell
    $response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https://management.azure.com/' 
    -Method GET -Headers @{Metadata="true"}

    $content = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json

    $ArmToken = $content.access_token
    ```
- Call Azure Resource Manager using access token
    ```powershell
    (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE GROUP>?api-version=2016-06-01 
    -Method GET -ContentType "application/json" 
    -Headers @{ Authorization ="Bearer $ArmToken"}).content
