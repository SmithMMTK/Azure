### Review of IP Addressing

__Overview of IP Addressing__

1. Private IP addresses: Used for communication within an Azure virtual network (VNet), and your on-premises network, when you use a VPN gateway or ExpressRoute circuit to extend your network to Azure.

2. Public IP addresses: Used for communication with the Internet, including Azure public-facing services.

    IP addresses can also be statically assigned or dynamically assigned. Static IP addresses do not change and are best for certain situations such as:
    
    - DNS name resolution, where a change in the IP address would require updating host records.
    
    - IP address-based security models which require apps or services to have a static IP address.
    
    - SSL certificates linked to an IP address.
    
    - Firewall rules that allow or deny traffic using IP address ranges.
    
    - Role-based VMs such as Domain Controllers and DNS servers.

    >As a best practice you may decide to separate dynamically and statically assigned IP resources into different subnets. And, IP Addresses are never managed from within a virtual machine.

__Public IP Addresses__

A public IP address resource can be associated with virtual machine network interfaces, internet-facing load balancers, VPN gateways, and application gateways. Azure can provide an IP address (dynamic assignment) or you can assign the IP address (static assignment). The type of resource affects the assignment.

Public IP addresses |	IP address association	| Dynamic	| Static
--- | --- | --- | ---
Virtual Machine | NIC | Yes | Yes
Load Balancer | Front-end configuration | Yes | Yes
VPN Gateway | Gateway IP configuration | Yes | No
Application Gateway | Front-end configuration | Yes | No

__Private IP Addresses__

A private IP address resource can be associated with virtual machine network interfaces, internal load balancers, and application gateways. Azure can provide an IP address (dynamic assignment) or you can assign the IP address (static assignment).

Private IP Addresses	| IP address association	| Dynamic	| Static
--- | --- | --- | ---
Virtual Machine | NIC | Yes | Yes
Internal Load Balancer | Front-end configuration | Yes | Yes
Application Gateway | Front-end configuration | Yes | Yes
