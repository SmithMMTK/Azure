### Review of IP Addressing

__Overview of IP Addressing__

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/f3c4137c2fa799e47cfe7d2281ec8c32/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.4_Configuring_and_Managing_Virtual_Networks_image9.png)

1. Private IP addresses: Used for communication within an Azure virtual network (VNet), and your on-premises network, when you use a VPN gateway or ExpressRoute circuit to extend your network to Azure.

2. Public IP addresses: Used for communication with the Internet, including Azure public-facing services.

    IP addresses can also be statically assigned or dynamically assigned. Static IP addresses do not change and are best for certain situations such as:
    
    - DNS name resolution, where a change in the IP address would require updating host records.
    
    - IP address-based security models which require apps or services to have a static IP address.
    
    - SSL certificates linked to an IP address.
    
    - Firewall rules that allow or deny traffic using IP address ranges.
    
    - Role-based VMs such as Domain Controllers and DNS servers.

    >As a best practice you may decide to separate dynamically and statically assigned IP resources into different subnets. And, IP Addresses are never managed from within a virtual machine.

__Public IP Addresses__

A public IP address resource can be associated with virtual machine network interfaces, internet-facing load balancers, VPN gateways, and application gateways. Azure can provide an IP address (dynamic assignment) or you can assign the IP address (static assignment). The type of resource affects the assignment.

Public IP addresses |	IP address association	| Dynamic	| Static
--- | --- | --- | ---
Virtual Machine | NIC | Yes | Yes
Load Balancer | Front-end configuration | Yes | Yes
VPN Gateway | Gateway IP configuration | Yes | No
Application Gateway | Front-end configuration | Yes | No

__Address SKUs__

__Private IP Addresses__

A private IP address resource can be associated with virtual machine network interfaces, internal load balancers, and application gateways. Azure can provide an IP address (dynamic assignment) or you can assign the IP address (static assignment).

Private IP Addresses	| IP address association	| Dynamic	| Static
--- | --- | --- | ---
Virtual Machine | NIC | Yes | Yes
Internal Load Balancer | Front-end configuration | Yes | Yes
Application Gateway | Front-end configuration | Yes | Yes

__Service Endpoints__

A virtual network service endpoint provides the identity of your virtual network to the Azure service. Once service endpoints are enabled in your virtual network, you can secure Azure service resources to your virtual network by adding a virtual network rule to the resources.

Today, Azure service traffic from a virtual network uses public IP addresses as source IP addresses. With service endpoints, service traffic switches to use virtual network private addresses as the source IP addresses when accessing the Azure service from a virtual network. This switch allows you to access the services without the need for reserved, public IP addresses used in IP firewalls.

### Network Routing

__System Routes__

Azure uses __system routes__ to direct network traffic between virtual machines, on-premises networks, and the Internet. The following situations are managed by these system routes:

- Traffic between VMs in the same subnet.

- Between VMs in different subnets in the same virtual network.

- Data flow from VMs to the Internet.

- Communication between VMs using a VNet-to-VNet VPN.

- Site-to-Site and ExpressRoute communication through the VPN gateway.

For example, consider this virtual network with two subnets. Communication between the subnets and from the frontend to the internet are all managed by Azure using the default system routes.

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/a01a3606834e200c3a221ba1636e3f1c/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.4_Configuring_and_Managing_Virtual_Networks_image15.png)

Information about the system routes is recorded in a route table. A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that specifies how packets should be routed in a virtual network. Route tables are associated to subnets, and each packet leaving a subnet is handled based on the associated route table. Packets are matched to routes using the destination. The destination can be an IP address, a virtual network gateway, a virtual appliance, or the internet. If a matching route can't be found, then the packet is dropped.

__Routing priorities__

1. User-defined route
2. BGP route
3. System route
 

__User Defined Routes__
As you have just read, Azure automatically handles all network traffic routing. But, what if you want to do something different? For example, you may have a VM that performs a network function, such as routing, firewalling, or WAN optimization. You may want certain subnet traffic to be directed to this virtual appliance. For example, you might place an appliance between subnets or a subnet and the internet.

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/adf02788610ac036423cd021e5dafc49/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.4_Configuring_and_Managing_Virtual_Networks_image16.png)

In these situations, you can configure user-defined routes (UDRs). UDRs control network traffic by defining routes that specify the next hop of the traffic flow. This hop can be a virtual network gateway, virtual network, internet, or virtual appliance.

>Each route table can be associated to multiple subnets, but a subnet can only be associated to a single route table.

__Routing Example__
Let’s look at a specific example where you have a virtual network that includes 3 subnets: Private, DMZ, and Public. In the DMZ subnet there is a network virtual appliance (NVA). You want to ensure all traffic from the Public subnet goes through the NVA to the Private subnet.

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/18e417cab8e7b15088339706eca7cc17/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.4_Configuring_and_Managing_Virtual_Networks_image17.png)

Let’s look at how we could implement this scenario by creating the route table, creating the route, and associating the route to the subnet.

__Create Route Table__

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/e6799afff49cd70ec04413f50ba5ca50/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.4_Configuring_and_Managing_Virtual_Networks_image19.png)

BGP is the standard routing protocol commonly used on the Internet to exchange routing and reachability information between two or more networks. Routes are automatically added to the route table of all subnets with BGP propagation enabled. In many situations this is what you want. For example, if you are using ExpressRoute you would want all subnets to know about that routing. Read more at the reference links.

### Intersite Connectivity

__VNet-to-VNet Connections__

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/3a96f2e92ad26832b08a750b929b1069/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.4_Configuring_and_Managing_Virtual_Networks_image50.png)

With a VNet-to-VNet connection your VNets can be:

- in the same or different regions.
- in the same or different subscriptions.
- in the same or different deployment models.
- in Azure or on-premises.

__Implementing VNet-to-VNet VPN__

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/e242df7d3a24012a29a00bbc5c206686/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.4_Configuring_and_Managing_Virtual_Networks_image51.png)

1. Create VPN Gateway
    ![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/bf48619a2108d4e935617cbe5bd2773b/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.4_Configuring_and_Managing_Virtual_Networks_image52.png)
    
    __VPN Types__
    There are two VPN types:
    - __Policy-based VPNs.__ Policy-based VPNs encrypt and direct packets through IPsec tunnels based on the IPsec policies configured with the combinations of address prefixes between your on-premises network and the Azure VNet. The policy (or traffic selector) is usually defined as an access list in the VPN device configuration. When using a Policy-based VPN, keep in mind the following limitations:
        - Policy-Based VPNs can only be used on the Basic gateway SKU and is not compatible with other gateway SKUs.
        - You can have only 1 tunnel when using a Policy-based VPN.
        - You can only use Policy-based VPNs for S2S connections, and only for certain configurations. Most VPN Gateway configurations require a Route-based VPN.
    - __Route-based VPNs.__ Route-based VPNs use routes in the IP forwarding or routing table to direct packets into their corresponding tunnel interfaces. The tunnel interfaces then encrypt or decrypt the packets in and out of the tunnels. The policy (or traffic selector) for Route-based VPNs are configured as any-to-any (or wild cards).
    > Once a virtual network gateway has been created, you can't change the VPN type.

2. Configure Gateway Connections

    ![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/8b624bd5a0ae732b866e76aa20b4aaa3/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.4_Configuring_and_Managing_Virtual_Networks_image54.png)
    
__Create Gateway Subnet__

Before creating a virtual network gateway for your virtual network, you first need to create the gateway subnet. The gateway subnet contains the IP addresses that are used by the virtual network gateway. If possible, it's best to create a gateway subnet by using a CIDR block of /28 or /27 to provide enough IP addresses to accommodate future additional configuration requirements.

When you create your gateway subnet, gateway VMs are deployed to the gateway subnet and configured with the required VPN gateway settings. You must never deploy other resources (for example, additional VMs) to the gateway subnet. The gateway subnet must be named GatewaySubnet.

### Virtual Network Perring

__VNet Peering__
Perhaps the simplest and quickest way to connect your VNets is to use VNet peering. Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect two Azure virtual networks. Once peered, the virtual networks appear as one, for connectivity purposes. There are two types of VNet peering.

- __Regional VNet peering__ connects Azure virtual networks in the same region.
- __Global VNet peering__ connects Azure virtual networks in different regions.

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/4f6f175400fd1e6cdda2fbecf741a86f/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.4_Configuring_and_Managing_Virtual_Networks_image57.png)

__Gateway Transit__

When you allow gateway transit the virtual network can communicate to resources outside the peering. For example, the subnet gateway could:

- Use a site-to-site VPN to connect to an on-premises network.

- Use a VNet-to-VNet connection to another virtual network.

- Use a point-to-site VPN to connect to a client.

In these scenarios, __gateway transit allows peered virtual networks to share the gateway and get access to resources__. This means you do not need to deploy a VPN gateway in the peer virtual network.

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/65d80dfa4622cc0f4025c9b865a1bda2/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.4_Configuring_and_Managing_Virtual_Networks_image61.png)

>When you create your virtual network gateway, gateway VMs are deployed to the gateway subnet and configured with the required VPN gateway settings. You must never deploy anything else (for example, additional VMs) to the gateway subnet. The gateway subnet must be named ‘GatewaySubnet’.

This architecture is often referred to as a hub-spoke topology in Azure. In the illustration at the beginning of this topic, VNet1 is the hub and acts as a central point of connectivity to external resources. VNet2 is the spoke that peers with the hub and can be used to isolate workloads.

>When working with gateway subnets, avoid associating a network security group (NSG) to the gateway subnet. Associating a network security group to this subnet may cause your VPN gateway to stop functioning as expected.

__Service Chaining__

VNet Peering is nontransitive. This means that if you establish VNet Peering between VNet1 and VNet2 and between VNet2 and VNet3, VNet Peering capabilities do not apply between VNet1 and VNet3. However, you can leverage user-defined routes and service chaining to implement custom routing that will provide transitivity. This allows you to:

- Implement a multi-level hub and spoke architecture.
- Overcome the limit on the number of VNet Peerings per virtual network.

__Hub and spoke architecture__

You can deploy hub-and-spoke networks, where the hub virtual network can host infrastructure components such as a network virtual appliance or VPN gateway. All the spoke virtual networks can then peer with the hub virtual network. Traffic can flow through network virtual appliances or VPN gateways in the hub virtual network.
