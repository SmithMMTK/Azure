- 1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process
- 2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received, understood and accepted
- 3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
- 4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
- 5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request

__Competing consumers pattern__

__Problem: handling variable quantities of requests__

An application running in the cloud may be expected to handle a large number of requests. The number of requests could vary significantly over time for many reasons. A sudden burst in user activity or aggregated requests coming from multiple tenants may cause an unpredictable workload. At peak hours, a system might need to process many hundreds of requests per second, while at other times, the number could be very small. Additionally, the nature of the work performed to handle these requests might be highly variable.

Using a single instance of the consumer service might cause that instance to become flooded with requests, or the messaging system may be overloaded by an influx of messages coming from the application.


__Solution: asynchronous messaging with variable quantities of message producers and consumers__

Rather than processing each request synchronously, a common technique is for the application to pass them through a messaging system to another service (a consumer service) that handles them asynchronously. This strategy helps to ensure that the business logic in the application is not blocked while the requests are being processed.

A message queue can be used to implement the communication channel between the application and the instances of the consumer service. To handle fluctuating workloads, the system can run multiple instances of the consumer service. The application posts requests in the form of messages to the queue, and the consumer service instances receive messages from the queue and process them. This approach enables the same pool of consumer service instances to handle messages from any instance of the application.

__Cache-aside pattern__

__Problem: cached data consistency__

Applications use a cache to optimize repeated access to information held in a data store. However, it is usually impractical to expect that cached data will always be completely consistent with the data in the data store. Application developers should consider a strategy that helps to ensure that the data in the cache is up-to-date as much as possible but that can also detect and handle situations that arise when the data in the cache has become stale.

__Solution: read-through and write-through caching__

Many commercial caching systems provide read-through and write-through/write-behind operations. In these systems, an application retrieves data by referencing the cache. If the data is not in the cache, it is transparently retrieved from the data store and added to the cache. Any modifications to data held in the cache are automatically written back to the data store, as well.

For caches that do not provide this functionality, it is the responsibility of the applications that use the cache to maintain the data in the cache. An application can emulate the functionality of read-through caching by implementing the cache-aside strategy. This strategy effectively loads data into the cache on demand if it's not already available in the cache.

__Sharding pattern__
