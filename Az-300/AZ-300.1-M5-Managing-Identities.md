### Manging Azure Active Directory (AAD)

__Azure Active Directory__

__Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)__

__Azure AD is different from AD DS__

Although Azure AD has many similarities to AD DS, there are also many differences. It is important to realize that using Azure AD is different from deploying an Active Directory domain controller on an Azure virtual machine and adding it to your on-premises domain. Here are some characteristics of Azure AD that make it different.

__Identity solution.__ Azure AD is primarily an identity solution, and it is designed for Internet-based applications by using HTTP and HTTPS communications.

__REST API Querying.__ Because Azure AD is HTTP/HTTPS based, it cannot be queried through LDAP. Instead, Azure AD uses the REST API over HTTP and HTTPS.

__Communication Protocols.__ Because Azure AD is HTTP/HTTPS based, it does not use Kerberos authentication. Instead, it uses HTTP and HTTPS protocols such as SAML, WS-Federation, and OpenID Connect for authentication (and OAuth for authorization).

__Federation Services.__ Azure AD includes federation services, and many third-party services (such as Facebook).

__Flat structure.__ Azure AD users and groups are created in a flat structure, and there are no Organizational Units (OUs) or Group Policy Objects (GPOs).

❗️Azure AD is a managed service. You only manage the users, groups, and policies. Deploying AD DS with virtual machines using Azure means that you manage the deployment, configuration, virtual machines, patching, and other backend tasks. Do you see the difference?

__Choosing Between Azure AD and Azure AD DS__

Aspect | Azure AD | Azure AD Domain Services
--- | --- | ---
Device controlled by | Azure AD | Azure AD Domain Services managed domain
Representation in the directory | Device objects in the Azure AD directory | Computer object in the AAD-DS managed domain
Authentication | OAuth/OpenID Connect based protocols | Kerberos, NTLM protocols
Management | Mobile Device Management (MDM) software like Intune | Group Policy
Networking | Workas over the internet | Requires machines to be on the same virtual networks as the managed domain
Great for | End-user mobile or desktop devices | Server virtual machines deployed in Azure

__Azure AD Directories (Tenants)__

A tenant is a dedicated instance of an Azure AD directory which is created whenever you sign up for a Microsoft cloud service, such as Office 365 or Azure. It is important to note; a tenant is not the same as a subscription. A subscription is typically tied to a credit card for billing, where a tenant is an instance of Active Directory. You can have multiple tenants in your organization, such as Contoso1.com and Contoso2.com .

Each tenant or Azure AD instance is separate and distinct from the other Azure AD directories in your organization. These different tenants could allow for different functions. For example: You could have a tenant for Office 365, another tenant a for testing environment, and then another tenant for Microsoft Intune. A tenant houses the users in a company and the information about them - their passwords, user profile data, permissions, and so on. It also contains groups, applications, and other information pertaining to an organization and its security.

__Built-in Roles__

Azure AD provides many built-in roles to cover the most common security scenarios. To understand how the roles work we will examine three roles that apply to all resource types:

- __Owner__ has full access to all resources including the right to delegate access to others.

- __Contributor__ can create and manage all types of Azure resources but can’t grant access to others.

- __Reader__ can view existing Azure resources.

__Role definitions__

ach role is a set of properties defined in a JSON file. This __role definition__ includes Name, Id, and Description. It also includes the allowable permissions (Actions), denied permissions (NotActions), and scope (read access, etc.) for the role.

For the Owner role that means all (*) actions, no denied actions, and all (/) scopes. This information is available with the __Get-AzureRmRoleDefinition cmdlet__.

__Actions and NotActions__
Built-in Role | Action | NotActions
--- | --- | ---
Owner | * |
Contributor | * | Microsoft.Authorization/*/Delete, Microsoft.Authorization/*/Write, Microsoft.Authorization/elevateAccess/Action
Reader | */read | 

__AssignableScopes__
Defining the Actions and NotActions properties is not enough to fully implement a role. You must also properly scope your role.

The AssignableScopes property of the role specifies the scopes (subscriptions, resource groups, or resources) within which the custom role is available for assignment. You can make the custom role available for assignment in only the subscriptions or resource groups that require it, and not clutter user experience for the rest of the subscriptions or resource groups.

- /subscriptions/[subscription id]
- /subscriptions/[subscription id]/resourceGroups/[resource group name]
- /subscriptions/[subscription id]/resourceGroups/[resource group name]/[resource]

```bash
az role assignment create –role $roleName \
–assignee $assigneeName –resource-group $resourceGroupName
```

__Summary__

- Do you need on-premises Active Directory integration? If the answer is No, then you would use Cloud-Only authentication.

- If you do need on-premises Active Directory integration, then do you need to use cloud authentication, password protection, and your authentication requirements are natively supported by Azure AD? If the answer is Yes, Then you would use __Password Hash Sync__ + Seamless SSO.

- If you do need on-premises Active Directory integration, but you do not need to use cloud authentication, password protection, and your authentication requirements are natively supported by Azure AD, then you would use __Pass-through Authentication__ Seamless SSO.

- if you need on-premises Active Directory integration, have an existing federation provider and your authentication requirements are NOT natively supported by Azure AD, then you would use __Federation__ authentication.

__Azure AD Connect Health__
Azure AD Connect Health allows you to monitor and gain insights into AD FS servers, Azure AD Connect, and Active Directory domain controllers. Azure AD Connect Health includes the top 50 users reports, which shows failed requests with wrong usernames and passwords in the last 30 days. An Azure AD Access Review shows "stale" users, users that have access and that the administrator may not need any more. To reduce the risk associated with stale access assignments, administrators can use Azure AD to create an access review for group members or users assigned to an application


__Password Synchronization__
In the background, the password synchronization component takes the user’s password hash from on-premises Active Directory, encrypts it, and passes it as a string to Azure. Azure decrypts the encrypted hash and stores the password hash as a user attribute in Azure AD.

It is important to understand that this is __same sign-in,__ not single sign-on. The user still authenticates against two separate directory services, albeit with the same user name and password. This solution provides a simple alternative to an AD FS implementation.

__Device writeback__
Device writeback is used to enable conditional access based on devices to Active Directory Federation Services (2012 R2 or higher) protected devices. To enable device writeback, devices must be located in the same forest as the users. With password writeback, you can configure Azure AD to write passwords back to your on-premises Active Directory.


__Pass-through Authentication__
