### Hybrid Networking

__Site-to-site connectivity__

A site-to-site VPN allows you to create a security-enhanced connection between your on-premises site and your virtual network. To create a site-to-site connection, a VPN device that is located on your on-premises network is configured to create a security-enhanced connection with the Azure Virtual Network gateway.

__Point-to-site connectivity__

A point-to-site VPN also allows you to create a security-enhanced connection to your virtual network. In a point-to-site configuration, the connection is configured individually on each client computer that you want to connect to the virtual network. Point-to-site connections do not require a VPN device. They work by using a VPN client that you install on each client computer. The VPN is established by manually starting the connection from the on-premises client computer. You can also configure the VPN client to automatically restart.
