1. Set the username and password needed for the administrator account on the virtual machine with Get-Credential:
    ```powershell
    $cred = Get-Credential
    ```
2. Create the initial configuration for the virtual machine with New-AzVMConfig:
    ```powershell
    $vm = New-AzVMConfig -VMName myVM -VMSize Standard_D1
    ```
3. Add the operating system information to the virtual machine configuration with Set-AzureRmVMOperatingSystem:
    ```powershell
    $vm = Set-AzVMOperatingSystem `
    -VM $vm `
    -Windows `
    -ComputerName myVM `
    -Credential $cred `
    -ProvisionVMAgent -EnableAutoUpdate 
    ```

4. Add the image information to the virtual machine configuration with Set-AzVMSourceImage:
    ```powershell
    $vm = Set-AzVMSourceImage `
    -VM $vm `
    -PublisherName MicrosoftWindowsServer `
    -Offer WindowsServer `
    -Skus 2016-Datacenter `
    -Version latest
    ```

5. Add the operating system disk settings to the virtual machine configuration with Set-AzVMOSDisk
    ```powershell
    $vm = Set-AzVMOSDisk `
    -VM $vm `
    -Name myOsDisk `
    -DiskSizeInGB 128 `
    -CreateOption FromImage `
    -Caching ReadWrite
    ```
6. Add the network interface card that you previously created to the virtual machine configuration with Add-AzureRmVMNetworkInterface:
    ```powershell
    $vm = Add-AzVMNetworkInterface -VM $vm -Id $nic.Id 
    ```

7. Create the virtual machine with New-AzVM.
    ```powershell
    New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroupVM -Location EastUS -VM $vm
    ```

__What is SSH?__

SSH is an encrypted connection protocol that allows secure sign-ins over unsecured connections. SSH is the default connection protocol for Linux VMs hosted in Azure. Although SSH itself provides an encrypted connection, using passwords with SSH connections still leaves the VM vulnerable to brute-force attacks or guessing of passwords. A more secure and preferred method of connecting to a VM using SSH is by using a public-private key pair, also known as SSH keys.

- The public key is placed on your Linux VM, or any other service that you wish to use with public-key cryptography.

- The private key remains on your local system. Protect this private key. Do not share it.

> Azure currently requires at least a 2048-bit key length and the SSH-RSA format for public and private keys.

### Backup and Restore

__Azure Site Recovery__

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/3934217ea681e47dd25f52367e8ee0a8/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ103_ASR_Scenarios.png)

Azure Site Recovery works in the following three scenarios:

- Hyper-V Virtual Machine Replication. When Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) is used to manage Hyper-V virtual machines, you can use Azure Site Recovery to replicate them to Azure or to a secondary datacenter. If you do not use VMM to manage your virtual machines, you can use Azure Site Recovery to replicate them to Azure only.

- VMware Virtual Machine Replication. You can perform the replication of virtual machines by VMware to a secondary site that is also running VMware. You also can replicate to Azure.

- Physical Windows and Linux machines. You can replicate physical machines running either Windows or Linux to a secondary site or to Azure.

__Virtual Machine Data Protection__

- __Azure Backup__

For backing up Azure VMs running production workloads, use Azure Backup. Azure Backup supports application-consistent backups for both Windows and Linux VMs. Azure Backup creates recovery points that are stored in geo-redundant recovery vaults. When you restore from a recovery point, you can restore the whole VM or just specific files. The topics in this lesson will focus on Azure Backup.

- __Azure Site Recovery__

Azure Site Recovery protects your VMs from a major disaster scenario when a whole region experiences an outage due to major natural disaster or widespread service interruption. You can configure Azure Site Recovery for your VMs so that you can recover your application with a single click in matter of minutes. You can replicate to an Azure region of your choice.

- __Managed disk snapshots__

In development and test environments, snapshots provide a quick and simple option for backing up VMs that use Managed Disks. A managed disk snapshot is a read-only full copy of a managed disk that is stored as a standard managed disk by default. With snapshots, you can back up your managed disks at any point in time. These snapshots exist independent of the source disk and can be used to create new managed disks. They are billed based on the used size. For example, if you create a snapshot of a managed disk with provisioned capacity of 64 GiB and actual used data size of 10 GiB, that snapshot is billed only for the used data size of 10 GiB.

- __Images__

Managed disks also support creating a managed custom image. You can create an image from your custom VHD in a storage account or directly from a generalized (sysprepped) VM. This process captures a single image. This image contains all managed disks associated with a VM, including both the OS and data disks. This managed custom image enables creating hundreds of VMs using your custom image without the need to copy or manage any storage accounts.

__Workload Protection Needs__
There are several methods for backing up virtual machines.

1. Enable backup for individual Azure VMs. When you enable backup, Azure Backup installs an extension to the Azure VM agent that's running on the VM. The agent backs up the entire VM.

2. Run the MARS agent on an Azure VM. This is useful if you want to back up individual files and folders on the VM.

3. Back up an Azure VM to a System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM) server or Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS) running in Azure. Then back up the DPM server/MABS to a vault using Azure Backup.

__Azure to Azure Architecture__
![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/474938e3bc75590f26aa0ffa9ea0094e/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ103_Azure_to_Azure.png)

When you enable replication for an Azure VM, the following happens:

1. The Site Recovery Mobility service extension is automatically installed on the VM. The extension registers the VM with Site Recovery. Continuous replication begins for the VM. Disk writes are immediately transferred to the cache storage account in the source location.
2. Site Recovery processes the data in the cache, and sends it to the target storage account, or to the replica managed disks.
3. After the data is processed, crash-consistent recovery points are generated every five minutes. App-consistent recovery points are generated according to the setting specified in the replication policy.
4. When you initiate a failover, the VMs are created in the target resource group, target virtual network, target subnet, and in the target availability set. During a failover, you can use any recovery point.


__Recovery Services Vault VM Backup Options__

__Recovery Services vault__ is a storage entity in Azure that houses data. The data is typically copies of data, or configuration information for virtual machines (VMs), workloads, servers, or workstations. You can use Recovery Services vaults to hold backup data for various Azure services such as IaaS VMs (Linux or Windows) and Azure SQL databases. Recovery Services vaults support System Center DPM, Windows Server, Azure Backup Server, and more. Recovery Services vaults make it easy to organize your backup data, while minimizing management overhead.

- The Recovery Services vault can be used to backup Azure virtual machines.

- The Recovery Services vault can be used to backup on-premises virtual machines including: Hyper-V, VmWare, System State, and Bare Metal Recovery.

__Implementing VM Backups__
![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/8f4edeffe2d14727018e269a14db53be/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ103_Imp_VM_Backups.png)

1. Create a recovery services vault. To back up your files and folders, you need to create a Recovery Services vault in the region where you want to store the data. You also need to determine how you want your storage replicated, either geo-redundant (default) or locally redundant. _By default, your vault has geo-redundant storage_. If you are using Azure as a primary backup storage endpoint, use the default geo-redundant storage. If you are using Azure as a non-primary backup storage endpoint, then choose locally redundant storage, which will reduce the cost of storing data in Azure.

2. Use the Portal to define the backup. Protect your data by taking snapshots of your data at defined intervals. These snapshots are known as recovery points, and they are stored in recovery services vaults. If or when it is necessary to repair or rebuild a VM, you can restore the VM from any of the saved recovery points. A backup policy defines a matrix of when the data snapshots are taken, and how long those snapshots are retained. When defining a policy for backing up a VM, you can trigger a backup job once a day.

3. Backup the virtual machine. The Azure VM Agent must be installed on the Azure virtual machine for the Backup extension to work. However, if your VM was created from the Azure gallery, then the VM Agent is already present on the virtual machine. _VMs that are migrated from on-premises data centers would not have the VM Agent installed_. In such a case, the VM Agent needs to be installed.

__Azure Backup Server__

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/42fdb9d2bea37bdfcc11d95006316baf/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ103_MABS.png)

__Steps__
1. Install the DPM or MABS protection agent on machines you want to protect. You then add the machines to a DPM protection group.
2. To protect on-premises machines, the DPM or MABS server must be located on-premises.
3. To protect Azure VMs, the MABS server must be located in Azure, running as an Azure VM.
4. With DPM/MABS, you can protect backup volumes, shares, files, and folders. You can also protect a machine's system state (bare metal), and you can protect specific apps with app-aware backup settings.
5. When you set up protection for a machine or app in DPM/MABS, you select to back up to the MABS/DPM local disk for short-term storage and to Azure for online protection. You also specify when the backup to local DPM/MABS storage should run and when the online backup to Azure should run.
6. The disk of the protected workload is backed up to the local MABS/DPM disks, according to the schedule you specified.
7. The DPM/MABS disks are backed up to the vault by the MARS agent that's running on the DPM/MABS server.

### Virtual Machine Extensions

Azure virtual machine extensions are small applications that provide post-deployment configuration and automation tasks on Azure VMs. For example, if a virtual machine requires software installation, anti-virus protection, or a configuration script inside, a VM extension can be used. Extensions are all about managing your virtual machines.

Azure VM extensions can be:

- Managed with Azure CLI, PowerShell, Azure Resource Manager templates, and the Azure portal.

- Bundled with a new VM deployment or run against any existing system. For example, they can be part of a larger deployment, configuring applications on VM provision, or run against any supported extension operated systems post deployment.

There are different extensions for Windows and Linux machines and a large choice of first and third-party extensions.

__Custom Script Extension (CSE)__ can be used to automatically launch and execute virtual machine customization tasks post configuration. Your script extension may perform very simple tasks such as stopping the virtual machine or installing a software component. However, the script could be more complex and perform a series of tasks.

__Implementation__

You can install the CSE from the Azure portal by accessing the virtual machines Extensions blade. Once the CSE resource is created, you will provide a PowerShell script file. Your script file will include the PowerShell commands you want to execute on the virtual machine. Optionally, you can pass in arguments, such as param1, param2. Once the file is uploaded it executes immediately.

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/029f38597f7136847e2de6d4d2c0b20d/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ103_CSE.png)

You could also use the PowerShell __Set-AzVmCustomScriptExtension__ command. You need to upload the script file to a blob container and provide the URI in the command like this:

```powershell
    Set-AzVmCustomScriptExtension -FileUri https://scriptstore.blob.core.windows.net/scripts/Install_IIS.ps1 \
    -Run "PowerShell.exe" -VmName vmName \
    -ResourceGroupName resourceGroup -Location "location" \
```

__Things to consider__

- Timeout. Custom Script extensions have 90 minutes to run. If your deployment exceeds this time, it is marked as a timeout. Keep this in mind when designing your script. And, of course, your virtual machine must be running to perform the tasks.

- Dependencies. If your extension requires networking or storage access, make sure that content is available.

- Failure events. Be sure to account for any errors that might occur when running your script. For example, running out of disk space, or security and access restrictions. What will the script do if there is an error?

- Sensitive data. Your extension may need sensitive information such as credentials, storage account names, and storage account access keys. How will you protect/encrypt this information?

__Desired State Configuration__
Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a management platform in Windows PowerShell that enables deploying and managing configuration data for software services and managing the environment in which these services run. DSC provides a set of Windows PowerShell language extensions, Windows PowerShell cmdlets, and resources that you can use to declaratively specify how you want your software environment to be configured. It also provides a means to maintain and manage existing configurations.

DSC centers around creating configurations. A configuration is an easy-to-read script that describes an environment made up of computers (nodes) with specific characteristics. These characteristics can be as simple as ensuring a specific Windows feature is enabled or as complex as deploying SharePoint. Use DSC when the CSE will not work for your application.

In this example we are installing IIS on the localhost. The configuration will saved as a .ps1 file.

```json
    configuration IISInstall
    {
        Node “localhost”
        {
        WindowsFeature IIS
        {
        Ensure = “Present”
        Name = “Web-Server”
        } } }
```
> The Windows PowerShell DSC comes with a set of built-in configuration resources. For example, File Resource, Log Resource, and User Resource. Use the reference link to view the resources that are available to you.
