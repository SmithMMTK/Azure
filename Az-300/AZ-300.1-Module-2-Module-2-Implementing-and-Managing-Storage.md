## Module 2 - Implementing and Managing Storage

### Azure Storage Accounts

- __Storage for Virtual Machines__. This includes disks and files. Disks are persistent block storage for Azure IaaS virtual machines. Files are fully managed file shares in the cloud.
- __Unstructured Data__. This includes Blobs and Data Lake Store. Blobs are highly scaleable, REST based cloud object store. Data Lake Store is Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) as a service.
- __Structured Data__. This includes Tables, Cosmos DB, and Azure SQL DB. Tables are a key/value, auto-scaling NoSQL store. Cosmos DB is a globally distributed database service. Azure SQL DB is a fully managed database-as-a-service built on SQL.

__Azure Storage services__

Azure Storage includes these data services, each of which is accessed through a storage account.

- __Azure Blobs__: A massively scalable object store for text and binary data.
- __Azure Files__: Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.
    >One thing that distinguishes Azure Files from files on a corporate file share is that you can access the files from anywhere in the world using a URL that points to the file and includes a shared access signature (SAS) token. You can generate SAS tokens; they allow specific access to a private asset for a specific amount of time.
- __Azure Queues__: A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components. 
    >Queue messages can be up to 64 KB in size.
- __Azure Tables__: A NoSQL store for schemaless storage of structured data.
    >Azure Table storage is now part of Azure Cosmos DB

__Standard and Premium Storage Accounts__

- __Standard__ storage accounts are backed by magnetic drives (HDD) and provide the lowest cost per GB. They are best for applications that require bulk storage or where data is accessed infrequently.

- __Premium__ storage accounts are backed by solid state drives (SSD) and offer consistent low-latency performance. They can only be used with Azure virtual machine disks and are best for I/O-intensive applications, like databases. Additionally, virtual machines that use Premium storage for all disks qualify for a 99.99% SLA, even when running outside an availability set.

> It is __not possible to convert__ a Standard storage account to Premium storage account or vice versa. You must create a new storage account with the desired type and copy data, if applicable, to a new storage account.

__Storage Account Types (Kinds)__
- __A general-purpose storage account__ gives you access to Azure Storage services such as tables, queues, files, blobs and Azure virtual machine disks under a single account. This type of storage account has two performance tiers:
    - A __standard storage performance tier__ which allows you to store tables, queues, files, blobs, and Azure virtual machine disks.

    - A __premium storage performance tier__ which currently only supports Azure virtual machine disks.
    
- __A Blob storage account__ is a specialized storage account for storing your unstructured data as blobs (objects) in Azure Storage. Blob storage has different tiers based on frequency of use:
    - __A Hot access tier__ which indicates that the objects in the storage account will be more frequently accessed.

    - __A Cool access tier__ which indicates that the objects in the storage account will be less frequently accessed.

    - __An Archive access tier__ which only applies to blob level storage in the general purpose v2 accounts.
    
        >To take advantage of the new archive access tier and for the lowest price per gigabyte, it's recommended that you create new storage accounts as general-purpose v2 accounts. You can upgrade your GPv1 account to a GPv2 account using PowerShell or Azure CLI.

__Storage Account Endpoints__

- Blob service: http://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net
- Table service: http://mystorageaccount.table.core.windows.net
- Queue service: http://mystorageaccount.queue.core.windows.net
- File service: http://mystorageaccount.file.core.windows.net

    > A Blob storage account only exposes the Blob service endpoint. And, you can also configure a custom domain name to use with your storage account.

__Configuring Custom Domain Names__
- __Direct CNAME mapping__ for example, to enable a custom domain for the blobs.contoso.com sub domain to an Azure storage account, create a CNAME record that points from blobs.contoso.com to the Azure storage account [storage account].blob.core.windows.net. The following example maps a domain to an Azure storage account in DNS:

CNAME record	| Target
--- | ---
blobs.contoso.com	| contosoblobs.blob.core.windows.net

- __Intermediary mapping with _asverify_ Mapping__ a domain that is already in use within Azure may result in minor downtime as the domain is updated. If you have an application with an SLA, by using the domain you can avoid the downtime by using a second option, the asverify subdomain, to validate the domain. By prepending asverify to your own subdomain, you permit Azure to recognize your custom domain without modifying the DNS record for the domain. After you modify the DNS record for the domain, it will be mapped to the blob endpoint with no downtime.

CNAME record	| Target
--- | ---
asverify.blobs.contoso.com	| asverify.contosoblobs.blob.core.windows.net
blobs.contoso.com	| contosoblobs.blob.core.windows.net

__Pricing and Billing__
- __Storage costs__: In addition to, the amount of data stored, the cost of storing data varies depending on the storage tier. The per-gigabyte cost decreases as the tier gets cooler.

- __Data access costs__: Data access charges increase as the tier gets cooler. For data in the cool and archive storage tier, you are charged a per-gigabyte data access charge for reads.

- __Transaction costs__: There is a per-transaction charge for all tiers that increases as the tier gets cooler.

- __Geo-Replication data transfer costs__: This charge only applies to accounts with geo-replication configured, including GRS and RA-GRS. Geo-replication data transfer incurs a per-gigabyte charge.

- __Outbound data transfer costs__: Outbound data transfers (data that is transferred out of an Azure region) incur billing for bandwidth usage on a per-gigabyte basis, consistent with general-purpose storage accounts.

- __Changing the storage tier__: Changing the account storage tier from cool to hot incurs a charge equal to reading all the data existing in the storage account. However, changing the account storage tier from hot to cool incurs a charge equal to writing all the data into the cool tier (GPv2 accounts only).

```powershell
    Get-AzLocation | select Location 
    $location = "westus" 
    $resourceGroup = "storage-demo-resource-group" 
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroup -Location $location 
    New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Name "storagedemo" -Location $location -SkuName Standard_LRS -Kind StorageV2
```

### Data Replication
__Replication Options__
![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/32765871b4e12afbd12531dfe8291760/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.2_Implementing_and_Managing_Storage_image7.png)

When you create a Standard storage account there are four replications schemes: 
- Locally-redundant storage (__LRS__)
- Geo-redundant storage (__GRS__)
- Read-access geo-redundant storage (__RA-GRS__)
- Zone-redundant storage (__ZRS__).

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/e395c80ed6a1fb60b503aa1dfa51c4a4/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.2_Implementing_and_Managing_Storage_image8.png)

__Are there any costs to changing my account's replication strategy?__

It depends on your conversion path. Ordering from cheapest to the most expensive redundancy offering we have LRS, ZRS, GRS, and RA-GRS. 

For example:
- Going from LRS to anything will incur additional charges because you are going to a more sophisticated redundancy level. 
- Going to GRS or RA-GRS will incur an egress bandwidth charge because your data (in your primary region) is being replicated to your remote secondary region. 

    >This is a one-time charge at initial setup. After the data is copied, there are no further conversion charges. You will only be charged for replicating any new or updates to existing data. For details on bandwidth charges, see Azure Storage Pricing page.


- If you change from GRS to LRS, there is no additional cost, but your replicated data is deleted from the secondary location.

Note:
- If you select Premium performance only LRS replication will be available.

- If you create availability sets for your virtual machines, then Azure uses Zone-redundant Storage (ZRS).

- If you convert your storage account from GRS to LRS, there is no additional cost, but your replicated data is deleted from the secondary location.
- If you convert your storage account from RA-GRS to GRS or LRS, that account is billed as RA-GRS for an additional 30 days beyond the date that it was converted.



__Replication Option Comparison__
Replication	| Copies | Strategy
--- | --- | ---
Locally redundant storage (LRS)	| Maintains three copies of your data.	|Data is replicated three time within a single facility in a single region.
Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)    | 	Maintains three copies of your data.	| Data is replicated three times across two to three facilities, either within a single region or across two regions.
Geo-redundant storage (GRS)	| Maintains six copies of your data.	 |Data is replicated three times within the primary region and is also replicated three times in a secondary region hundreds of miles away from the primary region.


Read access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) | Maintains six copies of your data. | Data is replicated to a secondary geographic location and provides read access to your data in the secondary location.


Replication Option  |	LRS   | ZRS   |   GRS |   RA-GRS
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Node unavailability within a data center | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes
An entire data center (zonal or non-zonal) becomes unavailable | No | Yes | Yes | Yes
A region-wide outage | No | No | Yes | Yes
Read access to your data (in a remote, geo-replicated region) in the event of region-wide unavailability | No | No | No | Yes
Available in storage account types | GPv1, GPv2, Blob | Standard, GPv2 | GPv1, GPv2, Blob | GPv1, GPv2, Blob

__Locally-redundant Storage__
LRS is the lowest-cost replication option and offers the least durability compared to other options. If a datacenter-level disaster (for example, fire or flooding) occurs, all replicas may be lost or unrecoverable. To mitigate this risk, Microsoft recommends using either zone-redundant storage (ZRS) or geo-redundant storage (GRS).

LRS may be appropriate in these scenarios:
- If your application stores data that can be easily reconstructed if data loss occurs, you may opt for LRS.
- Some applications are restricted to replicating data only within a country due to data governance requirements.

__Zone-redundant Storage__
Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS) synchronously replicates your data across three (3) storage clusters in a single region. Each storage cluster is physically separated from the others and resides in its own availability zone. Each availability zone, and the ZRS cluster within it, is autonomous, with separate utilities and networking capabilities.

Storing your data in a ZRS account ensures that you will be able access and manage your data if a zone becomes unavailable. ZRS provides excellent performance and extremely low latency.

Here are a few of more things to know about ZRS:

- ZRS is not yet available in all regions.
- Changing to ZRS from another data replication option requires the physical data movement from a single storage stamp to multiple stamps within a region.
- ZRS may not protect your data against a regional disaster where multiple zones are permanently affected. Instead, ZRS offers resiliency for your data in the case of unavailability.

>Consider ZRS for scenarios that require strong consistency, strong durability, and high availability even if an outage or natural disaster renders a zonal data center unavailable.
