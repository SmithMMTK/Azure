## Module 2 - Implementing and Managing Storage

### Azure Storage Accounts

- __Storage for Virtual Machines__. This includes disks and files. Disks are persistent block storage for Azure IaaS virtual machines. Files are fully managed file shares in the cloud.
__Unstructured Data__. This includes Blobs and Data Lake Store. Blobs are highly scaleable, REST based cloud object store. Data Lake Store is Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) as a service.
__Structured Data__. This includes Tables, Cosmos DB, and Azure SQL DB. Tables are a key/value, auto-scaling NoSQL store. Cosmos DB is a globally distributed database service. Azure SQL DB is a fully managed database-as-a-service built on SQL.

__Azure Storage services_

Azure Storage includes these data services, each of which is accessed through a storage account.

- __Azure Blobs__: A massively scalable object store for text and binary data.
- __Azure Files__: Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.
- __Azure Queues__: A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components. 
    >Queue messages can be up to 64 KB in size.
- __Azure Tables__: A NoSQL store for schemaless storage of structured data.
    >Azure Table storage is now part of Azure Cosmos DB

__Standard and Premium Storage Accounts__

- __Standard__ storage accounts are backed by magnetic drives (HDD) and provide the lowest cost per GB. They are best for applications that require bulk storage or where data is accessed infrequently.

- __Premium__ storage accounts are backed by solid state drives (SSD) and offer consistent low-latency performance. They can only be used with Azure virtual machine disks and are best for I/O-intensive applications, like databases. Additionally, virtual machines that use Premium storage for all disks qualify for a 99.99% SLA, even when running outside an availability set.

> It is __not possible to convert__ a Standard storage account to Premium storage account or vice versa. You must create a new storage account with the desired type and copy data, if applicable, to a new storage account.
