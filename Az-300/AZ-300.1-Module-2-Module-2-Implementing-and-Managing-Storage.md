## Module 2 - Implementing and Managing Storage

### Azure Storage Accounts

- __Storage for Virtual Machines__. This includes disks and files. Disks are persistent block storage for Azure IaaS virtual machines. Files are fully managed file shares in the cloud.
- __Unstructured Data__. This includes Blobs and Data Lake Store. Blobs are highly scaleable, REST based cloud object store. Data Lake Store is Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) as a service.
- __Structured Data__. This includes Tables, Cosmos DB, and Azure SQL DB. Tables are a key/value, auto-scaling NoSQL store. Cosmos DB is a globally distributed database service. Azure SQL DB is a fully managed database-as-a-service built on SQL.

__Azure Storage services__

Azure Storage includes these data services, each of which is accessed through a storage account.

- __Azure Blobs__: A massively scalable object store for text and binary data.
- __Azure Files__: Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.
    >One thing that distinguishes Azure Files from files on a corporate file share is that you can access the files from anywhere in the world using a URL that points to the file and includes a shared access signature (SAS) token. You can generate SAS tokens; they allow specific access to a private asset for a specific amount of time.
- __Azure Queues__: A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components. 
    >Queue messages can be up to 64 KB in size.
- __Azure Tables__: A NoSQL store for schemaless storage of structured data.
    >Azure Table storage is now part of Azure Cosmos DB

__Standard and Premium Storage Accounts__
![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/3a9e8614ced5790bc3ab38e5e2ba726e/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.2_Implementing_and_Managing_Storage_image4.png)

- __Standard__ storage accounts are backed by magnetic drives (HDD) and provide the lowest cost per GB. They are best for applications that require bulk storage or where data is accessed infrequently.

- __Premium__ storage accounts are backed by solid state drives (SSD) and offer consistent low-latency performance. They can only be used with Azure virtual machine disks and are best for I/O-intensive applications, like databases. Additionally, virtual machines that use Premium storage for all disks qualify for a 99.99% SLA, even when running outside an availability set.

> It is __not possible to convert__ a Standard storage account to Premium storage account or vice versa. You must create a new storage account with the desired type and copy data, if applicable, to a new storage account.

__Storage Account Types (Kinds)__
- __A general-purpose storage account__ gives you access to Azure Storage services such as tables, queues, files, blobs and Azure virtual machine disks under a single account. This type of storage account has two performance tiers:
    - A __standard storage performance tier__ which allows you to store tables, queues, files, blobs, and Azure virtual machine disks.

    - A __premium storage performance tier__ which currently only supports Azure virtual machine disks.
    
- __A Blob storage account__ is a specialized storage account for storing your unstructured data as blobs (objects) in Azure Storage. Blob storage has different tiers based on frequency of use:
    - __A Hot access tier__ which indicates that the objects in the storage account will be more frequently accessed.

    - __A Cool access tier__ which indicates that the objects in the storage account will be less frequently accessed.

    - __An Archive access tier__ which only applies to blob level storage in the general purpose v2 accounts.
    
        >To take advantage of the new archive access tier and for the lowest price per gigabyte, it's recommended that you create new storage accounts as general-purpose v2 accounts. You can upgrade your GPv1 account to a GPv2 account using PowerShell or Azure CLI.
        
        ![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/bd2e20b5a2d5f84896bc9f0247b03a14/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.2_Implementing_and_Managing_Storage_image3.png)

__Storage Account Endpoints__

- Blob service: http://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net
- Table service: http://mystorageaccount.table.core.windows.net
- Queue service: http://mystorageaccount.queue.core.windows.net
- File service: http://mystorageaccount.file.core.windows.net

    > A Blob storage account only exposes the Blob service endpoint. And, you can also configure a custom domain name to use with your storage account.

__Configuring Custom Domain Names__
- __Direct CNAME mapping__ for example, to enable a custom domain for the blobs.contoso.com sub domain to an Azure storage account, create a CNAME record that points from blobs.contoso.com to the Azure storage account [storage account].blob.core.windows.net. The following example maps a domain to an Azure storage account in DNS:

CNAME record	| Target
--- | ---
blobs.contoso.com	| contosoblobs.blob.core.windows.net

- __Intermediary mapping with _asverify_ Mapping__ a domain that is already in use within Azure may result in minor downtime as the domain is updated. If you have an application with an SLA, by using the domain you can avoid the downtime by using a second option, the asverify subdomain, to validate the domain. By prepending asverify to your own subdomain, you permit Azure to recognize your custom domain without modifying the DNS record for the domain. After you modify the DNS record for the domain, it will be mapped to the blob endpoint with no downtime.

CNAME record	| Target
--- | ---
asverify.blobs.contoso.com	| asverify.contosoblobs.blob.core.windows.net
blobs.contoso.com	| contosoblobs.blob.core.windows.net

__Pricing and Billing__
- __Storage costs__: In addition to, the amount of data stored, the cost of storing data varies depending on the storage tier. The per-gigabyte cost decreases as the tier gets cooler.

- __Data access costs__: Data access charges increase as the tier gets cooler. For data in the cool and archive storage tier, you are charged a per-gigabyte data access charge for reads.

- __Transaction costs__: There is a per-transaction charge for all tiers that increases as the tier gets cooler.

- __Geo-Replication data transfer costs__: This charge only applies to accounts with geo-replication configured, including GRS and RA-GRS. Geo-replication data transfer incurs a per-gigabyte charge.

- __Outbound data transfer costs__: Outbound data transfers (data that is transferred out of an Azure region) incur billing for bandwidth usage on a per-gigabyte basis, consistent with general-purpose storage accounts.

- __Changing the storage tier__: Changing the account storage tier from cool to hot incurs a charge equal to reading all the data existing in the storage account. However, changing the account storage tier from hot to cool incurs a charge equal to writing all the data into the cool tier (GPv2 accounts only).

```powershell
    Get-AzLocation | select Location 
    $location = "westus" 
    $resourceGroup = "storage-demo-resource-group" 
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroup -Location $location 
    New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Name "storagedemo" -Location $location -SkuName Standard_LRS -Kind StorageV2
```

### Data Replication
__Replication Options__
![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/32765871b4e12afbd12531dfe8291760/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.2_Implementing_and_Managing_Storage_image7.png)

When you create a Standard storage account there are four replications schemes: 
- Locally-redundant storage (__LRS__)
- Geo-redundant storage (__GRS__)
- Read-access geo-redundant storage (__RA-GRS__)
- Zone-redundant storage (__ZRS__).

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/e395c80ed6a1fb60b503aa1dfa51c4a4/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.2_Implementing_and_Managing_Storage_image8.png)

__Are there any costs to changing my account's replication strategy?__

It depends on your conversion path. Ordering from cheapest to the most expensive redundancy offering we have LRS, ZRS, GRS, and RA-GRS. 

For example:
- Going from LRS to anything will incur additional charges because you are going to a more sophisticated redundancy level. 
- Going to GRS or RA-GRS will incur an egress bandwidth charge because your data (in your primary region) is being replicated to your remote secondary region. 

    >This is a one-time charge at initial setup. After the data is copied, there are no further conversion charges. You will only be charged for replicating any new or updates to existing data. For details on bandwidth charges, see Azure Storage Pricing page.


- If you change from GRS to LRS, there is no additional cost, but your replicated data is deleted from the secondary location.

Note:
- If you select Premium performance only LRS replication will be available.

- If you create availability sets for your virtual machines, then Azure uses Zone-redundant Storage (ZRS).

- If you convert your storage account from GRS to LRS, there is no additional cost, but your replicated data is deleted from the secondary location.
- If you convert your storage account from RA-GRS to GRS or LRS, that account is billed as RA-GRS for an additional 30 days beyond the date that it was converted.



__Replication Option Comparison__

Replication	| Copies | Strategy
--- | --- | ---
Locally redundant storage (LRS)	| Maintains three copies of your data.	|Data is replicated three time within a single facility in a single region.
Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)    | 	Maintains three copies of your data.	| Data is replicated three times across two to three facilities, either within a single region or across two regions.
Geo-redundant storage (GRS)	| Maintains six copies of your data.	 |Data is replicated three times within the primary region and is also replicated three times in a secondary region hundreds of miles away from the primary region.
Read access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) | Maintains six copies of your data. | Data is replicated to a secondary geographic location and provides read access to your data in the secondary location.


Replication Option  |	LRS   | ZRS   |   GRS |   RA-GRS
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Node unavailability within a data center | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes
An entire data center (zonal or non-zonal) becomes unavailable | No | Yes | Yes | Yes
A region-wide outage | No | No | Yes | Yes
Read access to your data (in a remote, geo-replicated region) in the event of region-wide unavailability | No | No | No | Yes
Available in storage account types | GPv1, GPv2, Blob | Standard, GPv2 | GPv1, GPv2, Blob | GPv1, GPv2, Blob
[( More ... )](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy-grs)

__Locally-redundant Storage__
LRS is the lowest-cost replication option and offers the least durability compared to other options. If a datacenter-level disaster (for example, fire or flooding) occurs, all replicas may be lost or unrecoverable. To mitigate this risk, Microsoft recommends using either zone-redundant storage (ZRS) or geo-redundant storage (GRS).

Replication	| Copies | Strategy
--- | --- | ---
Locally redundant storage (LRS)	| Maintains three copies of your data.	|Data is replicated three time within a single facility in a single region.


LRS may be appropriate in these scenarios:
- If your application stores data that can be easily reconstructed if data loss occurs, you may opt for LRS.
- Some applications are restricted to replicating data only within a country due to data governance requirements.

__Zone-redundant Storage__
Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS) synchronously replicates your data across three (3) storage clusters in a single region. Each storage cluster is physically separated from the others and resides in its own availability zone. Each availability zone, and the ZRS cluster within it, is autonomous, with separate utilities and networking capabilities.

Replication	| Copies | Strategy
--- | --- | ---
Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)    | 	Maintains three copies of your data.	| Data is replicated three times across two to three facilities, either within a single region or across two regions.

Storing your data in a ZRS account ensures that you will be able access and manage your data if a zone becomes unavailable. ZRS provides excellent performance and extremely low latency.

Here are a few of more things to know about ZRS:

- ZRS is not yet available in all regions.
- Changing to ZRS from another data replication option requires the physical data movement from a single storage stamp to multiple stamps within a region.
- ZRS may not protect your data against a regional disaster where multiple zones are permanently affected. Instead, ZRS offers resiliency for your data in the case of unavailability.

>Consider ZRS for scenarios that require strong consistency, strong durability, and high availability even if an outage or natural disaster renders a zonal data center unavailable.

__Geo-redundant storage__

Geo-redundant storage (GRS) is the default and recommended replication option and is sometimes called cross-regional replication. GRS replicates your data to a secondary region (hundreds of miles away from the primary location of the source data).

Replication	| Copies | Strategy
--- | --- | ---
Geo-redundant storage (GRS)	| Maintains six copies of your data.	 |Data is replicated three times within the primary region and is also replicated three times in a secondary region hundreds of miles away from the primary region.
Read access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) | Maintains six copies of your data. | Data is replicated to a secondary geographic location and provides read access to your data in the secondary location.


If you opt for GRS, you have two related options to choose from:

- __GRS__ replicates your data to another data center in a secondary region, but that data is available to be read only if Microsoft initiates a failover from the primary to secondary region.

- __Read-access geo-redundant storage__ (RA-GRS) is based on GRS. RA-GRS replicates your data to another data center in a secondary region, and also provides you with the option to read from the secondary region. With RA-GRS, you can read from the secondary regardless of whether Microsoft initiates a failover from the primary to the secondary.

__What is the RPO and RTO with GRS?__
__Recovery Point Objective (RPO):__
- __Recovery Point Objective (RPO):__ Azure Storage typically has an RPO of less than 15 minutes, although there's currently no SLA on how long geo-replication takes.
    - The time until the customer initiates the failover of the storage account from the primary to the secondary region.
    - The time required by Azure to perform the failover by changing the primary DNS entries to point to the secondary location.

__Storage Accounts PowerShell Tasks__
```powershell
## Check to see if a storage account name is available.
Get-AzureRmStorageAccountNameAvailability -Name ‘mystorageaccount’

## Create a storage account.
New-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroup -AccountName mystorageaccount -Location westus -SkuName Standard_GRS

## Retrieve a specific storage account or all the storage accounts in a resource group or subscription.
Get-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "RG01" -AccountName “mystorageaccount”

## Modify storage account properties, such as type
Set-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -AccountName “mystorageaccount” -Type "Standard_RAGRS"

### Storing and Access Data
__Import and Export Service__

- __Import__. Securely transfer large amounts of data to Azure Blob storage (block and page blobs) and Azure Files by shipping disk drives to an Azure data center. In this case, you will be shipping hard drives containing your data.

- __Export__. Transfer data from Azure storage to hard disk drives and ship to your on-premise sites. Currently, you can only export Block blobs, Page blobs or Append blobs from Azure storage using this service. Exporting Azure Files is not currently supported. In this case, you will be shipping empty hard drives.


__Import and Export service components__
- __Import/Export service__. This service available in Azure portal helps the user create and track data import (upload) and export (download) jobs.

- __WAImportExport tool__. This is a command-line tool that does the following:
    - Prepares your disk drives that are shipped for import.
    - Facilitates copying your data to the drive.
    - Encrypts the data on the drive with BitLocker.
    - Generates the drive journal files used during import creation.
    - Helps identify numbers of drives needed for export jobs.
    

    >The WAImportExport tool is available in two versions, version 1 and 2. We recommend that you use: Version 1 for import/export into Azure Blob storage. Version 2 for importing data into Azure files.
    
    > __What is a journal file?__
    > Each time you run the WAImportExport tool to copy files to the hard drive, the tool creates a copy session. The state of the copy session is written to the journal file. If a copy session is interrupted (for example, due to a system power loss), it can be resumed by running the tool again and specifying the journal file on the command line.
    > 
    > For each hard drive that you prepare with the Azure Import/Export Tool, the tool will create a single journal file with name DriveID.xml where DriveID is the serial number associated to the drive that the tool reads from the disk. You will need the journal files from all of your drives to create the import job. The journal file can also be used to resume drive preparation if the tool is interrupted.
    
- __Disk Drives__. You can ship Solid-state drives (SSDs) or Hard disk drives (HDDs) to the Azure datacenter. When creating an import job, you ship disk drives containing your data. When creating an export job, you ship empty drives to the Azure datacenter.

__Supported storage accounts__

- General Purpose v2 storage accounts (recommended for most scenarios)
Blob Storage accounts
- General Purpose v1 storage accounts (both Classic or Azure Resource Manager deployments)

__Supported storage types__

- Import jobs can include Azure Blob storage, Azure File storage, Blob blobs, and Page blobs.
- Export jobs can include Azure Blob storage, Block blobs, Page blobs, and Append blobs. Azure Files not supported.

__AzCopy__
- Synchronize a file system to Azure Blob or vice versa. Ideal for incremental copy scenarios.
- Supports Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 APIs.
- Supports copying an entire account (Blob service only) to another account.
- Account to account copy is now using the new Put from URL APIs. No data transfer to the client is needed which makes the transfer faster.
- List/Remove files and blobs in a given path.
- Supports wildcard patterns in a path as well as –include and –exclude flags.
- Improved resiliency: every AzCopy instance will create a job order and a related log file. You can view and restart previous jobs and resume failed jobs. AzCopy will also automatically retry a transfer after a failure.
- General performance improvements.


__Content Delivery Network (CDN)__
A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver content to users. CDNs store cached content on edge servers that are close to end-users.

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/31685bbcf1d01cb8f938456397edb720/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ103_CDN_Benefits.png)

__CDN Profiles__

A CDN profile is a collection of CDN endpoints with the same pricing tier and provider (origin). You may create multiple profiles to organize endpoints. For example, you could have profiles with endpoints to different internet domains, web applications, or storage accounts. You can create up to 8 CDN profiles per subscription.

![alt text](https://openedx.microsoft.com/assets/courseware/v1/0b65f18b9dc6d4d0c9b9362cff6c70f2/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZ-300.1+2019_T2+type@asset+block/AZ-100.2_Implementing_and_Managing_Storage_image48.png)

__CDN Endpoints__
When you create a new CDN endpoint directly from the CDN profile blade you are prompted for CDN endpoint name, Origin type, and Origin hostname. To access cached content on the CDN, use the CDN URL provided in the portal. In this case,

```xml
    ASHStorage.azureedge.net/<myPublicContainer>/<BlobName>
```

### Monitoring Storage

__Monitor Metrics__
Azure Storage integrates Azure Monitor by sending metric data to the Azure Monitor platform. With metrics on Azure Storage, you can analyze usage trends, trace requests, and diagnose issues with your storage account.
